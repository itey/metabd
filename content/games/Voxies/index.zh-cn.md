Voxies are cute, lovable and collectible 3d voxel buddies, that live and play on the Ethereum blockchain. There are only 10,000 Voxies in existence and no two Voxies are identical. Lots of random properties and fun traits make each Voxie cute, unique and sometimes rare!<br> <br> Fight with your Voxies in turn based tactical combat battles, explore a 3d voxel-world, interact with NPCs to buy equipment for your Voxies &amp; more.
