Wildcard is a digital Collectible Card Game combined with a community-based ecosystem that allows creativity, fun, and profit all under the roof of TacoCat.<br> In the late 1980s, in a mall in middle America, an incident occurred. A sudden burst of energy from somewhere in outer space blasted directly into an arcade, shot through a local pet shop, and throughout the various restaurants at the food court. That night, it was reported that abominations were brought to life through some strange symbiosis. And now, nightly the floating spirits return to the inanimate objects to battle against each other for a purpose not yet known. <br> Wildcard is a 1v1 and single player digital Collectible Card Game combined with a community-based ecosystem that allows creativity, fun, and profit all under the roof of TacoCat Co.
