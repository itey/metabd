Last Expedition is the worldâ€™s first AAA first-person shooter powered by blockchain and player ownership. <br> Created by the renowned development studio Certain Affinity led by Halo 2 veteran Max Hoberman, Last Expedition will bring world class AAA gaming and play-to-earn empowerment together in a historic and explosive combination. <br> <br> In Last Expedition, players will face off against a hostile alien world in which everything and everyone wants to annihilate them. In addition to the intense focus and skill required for successful FPS gaming, blockchain ownership will allow for cutting edge layers of resourcefulness and strategy, requiring players to build, grow and survive in new ways.
