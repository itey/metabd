What is Crypto Nijigen？<br> Crypto Nijigen is a game centered around collecting, raising, and battling powerful heroes.<br> <br> Crypto Nijigen heroes come in various classes: warriors, archers, witchers, summoners, governors, thiefes and some legendary classes. Players will interact and power-up their heroes through minigames, quests, contests, and special in-game events.<br> <br> Crypto Nijigen uses the Ethereum Blockchain to ensure open, transparent ownership and a liquid, secure marketplace. Players have complete ownership of their heroes and equipments and will be able to trade and sell them smoothly and securely.<br> <br> Why was Crypto Nijigen created？<br> We believe that mainstream adoption of blockchain technology will come through simple, beautiful, decentralized applications (DAPPS). Armed with this belief, we built Crypto Nijigen in order to popularize blockchain and demonstrate its usefulness through a beautiful, social, and captivating game. While other Ethereum games have done well, most players have been frustrated by the lack of true playability and sense of progress. We’ve designed Crypto Nijigen to be the first game that allows players to truly engage with their digital collectibles.<br> <br> Why Play to Earn?<br> A game needs players. By simply playing the game, community members are adding value to the network and should be rewarded. It’s simple, but revolutionary. We are looking for missionaries to align incentives with as we change the gaming world forever.
