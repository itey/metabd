Moonscape is a resource management strategy game with optional DeFi mechanics available exclusively for Moonbeam Network. Collect and fight for resources as you grow your expanding moon-based empire. <br> <br> This online strategy city-builder will allow users to collect resources, plunder rival cities, and work together with allies in the pursuit of Moon-domination and unending profits! Unlike other DeFi games of this generation, all Gamefi elements are completely optional and can be engaged with or abandoned, at any point of the player's desire. This is the future of DeFi gaming. Moonscape is developed by Bitpunch games (based in Armenia), with game platform and smart contract support from the Seascape Network (Singapore)
