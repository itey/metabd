Buy planets, explore galaxy, mine resources, start civilization, spaceships races, battles<br> <br> Black Eye Galaxy [BYG] is a Metaverse designed to create a space exploration experience for<br> its members. BYG offers many assets from planets to spaceships and buildings – all tradeable,<br> transferable and truly owned by the player. BYG is a Play-To-Earn game meaning that just by doing<br> tasks in-game the player will be rewarded BYG tokens – a native currency of our Metaverse.<br> BYG runs on Binance Smart Chain primarily, since BSC offers very fast and cheap transactions<br> which makes the game more accessible to more people. However, to attract even more players BYG<br> will be integrating all mainstream Layer-1 Blockchains in its gameplay, i.e. Ethereum, Solana and etc.<br> <br> BYG Token is a standard BEP-20 token which will be used as the main currency for all<br> transactions – the player will be buying and selling NFT assets for and with BYG, the player will also<br> earn rewards in BYG token for completing various tasks.<br> <br> BYG uses the Non-Fungible tokens to manage all its Metaverse assets, meaning that every<br> planet, spaceships or building can be bought, sold and traded by the player and kept in his own<br> wallet – decentralized as it should be.<br> NFT assets are not the common tokens that can be traded on common DEXs like<br> PancakeSwap, thus BYG will use its own NFT marketplace in which all the aforementioned assets will<br> be bought and sold using the native BYG Token.<br> Our current NFT assets are:<br> 1. Planets and Spaceships (Built using ERC-721 standard).<br> 2. Star Alliances (Built using ERC-1155 standard).
