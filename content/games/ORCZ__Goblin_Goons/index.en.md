Battle Other Owners.<br> Win Ethereum.<br> <br> Introducing ORCZ:<br> The ORCZ faction are storming the gates of Ironstone to join the battle against the Goblin Goons and Ghost Goblins.<br> <br> Beginning mid-September, owners can join The Battle For Ironstone by holding either a Goblin, Ghost or ORC (releasing August 31st).<br> <br> Owners can fight each other in head-to-head battles to win a share of ETH from secondary sale royalties. Losers miss out on a chance to win ETH but their NFTs live to fight another day.<br> <br> One NFT = One Entry to The Battle For Ironstone<br> <br> Existing owners that hold either a Goblin or a Ghost can mint 1 ORC for free on release day.<br> <br> Owners receive 1 entry for each warrior they own (Goblins, Ghosts or ORCZ).<br> <br> For example, if an owner holds 25 warriors, they receive 25 entries to the battle. There is no limit to the amount of warriors each owner can enter. <br> <br> The Battle For Ironstone will begin 2 weeks after ORCZ release. Owners can join the battle by connecting their Metamask to the Goblin Goons Lair website and pressing 'Enter'.<br> <br> Joining the battle is completely free and doesn't require any gas fees because it takes place off-chain. <br> <br> A new battle season starts every 2 weeks and owners can re-enter their warriors to win a share of the new prize pool.<br> <br> Every warrior has at least a 25% chance of winning. However, some warriors are stronger than others and have up to a 75% chance of winning. <br> <br> Our proprietary algorithm uses each warrior's rarity ranking to determine its win probability. The ranking of each warrior is very similar to its rank on Rarity Tools.<br> <br> Each warrior is randomly matched with 3 opponents. The winner of each battle is decided by a combination of chance and rarity ranking.
