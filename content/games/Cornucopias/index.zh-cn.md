Cornucopias ‘The Island’ is a blockchain based play-to-earn, build-to-earn and learn-to-earn-MMORPG game where players can own land and other NFT (non fungible tokens) based assets that are tradeable in a peer-to-peer manner, all hosted in a fun and expanding metaverse (a virtual reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users).<br> <br> ‘The Island’ is split into a number of themed zones such as the ‘WildWest’ zone, ‘Farm Life’ zone and ‘Age of The Samurai’ zone, where people of all ages can play a series of mini games, getting lost in the play-to-earn ecosystem where they can earn digital assets as they explore and build in our safe and secure world.<br> <br> The more creative players can design their own items such as coffee tables, beds and other household furnishings which can then be minted into an ‘Island Blueprint’ that other players can then buy, gather the materials, and then craft in-game into a brand new NFT. Once created, the crafter can play with the items in their virtual dwelling or sell them onto other players to enjoy or sell on again.<br> <br> ‘The Island’ combines gaming with real-world commerce and gives opportunities for traditional and ecommerce companies to sell and promote their real-world brands, goods and services, to a hard to reach audience they have potentially never had access to before.<br> <br> Available worldwide, ‘The Island’ is built on the Unreal Engine 5 games engine which is compatible with the PC, mobile phone, games consoles and smart TV’s, and will be powered, governed and be forever evolving thanks to a growing number of communities including blockchain, Unreal game developers, Voxel, 3D artists and modelers and general game enthusiasts.<br> <br> Creators and players will be able to discover a new form of currency economics where they can create and trade their own NFT’s in-game or on 3rd party marketplaces, and no longer will their purchased game assets be confined inside a single game again.
