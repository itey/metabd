RetroCade is a decentralized Play to Earn token that became part of a powerful and vibrant ecosystem, built on the BSC network and inspired by the community. With the latest instant yield generation built inside this token, delivered in BUSD dividends, holders generate yield by holding RetroCade in their wallet, without any further action required. Rewards are auto distributed with all transactions, buys and sells.<br> <br> We plan to release our own Play To Earn version of classic arcade games and NFTs!
