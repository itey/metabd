Valhalla is a play-to-earn NFT gaming metaverse. In addition to being rewarded with $FLOKI for battling, everything that you obtain in the metaverse is yours to own and to sell as you intend (such as on FlokiPlaces).<br> <br> The team working on Valhalla have been working on NFT games since 2017, are at the head of a development team of 15, and are onboarding high-profile advisors with experience developing successful mainstream addictive games.
