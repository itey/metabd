Decentralized infant chaos has arrived! Collect, trade and do battle using blockchain technology. Rise the ranks and conquer the nursery!<br> <br> Before you enter the baby battlefield, you'll need a lead baby. You can take your pick from different babies available. Lead babies have 10 different attributes with experience points increasing from battles and quests.<br> <br> When your baby has had their nap and their stamina is recharged, they are free to do battle. Your baby will be matched against a random baby and fight on 3 of your 10 atrtibutes. Best of three wins!
