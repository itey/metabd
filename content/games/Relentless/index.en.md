The world’s first collectible card game to run entirely on the blockchain—mobile and PC. Funded on Kickstarter in 1 day.<br> <br> Relentless is a strategic, adrenaline-pumping, loot-filled, trading card game that runs 100% on the blockchain.<br> <br> What does that mean? It means you truly own your cards forever, and you can trade them with other players on a massive P2P Marketplace — just like you could with physical trading cards.<br> <br> And you can use these same cards in dozens of user-created custom game modes and tournaments — for the first time ever bringing the customizability of physical trading card games into the digital realm.
