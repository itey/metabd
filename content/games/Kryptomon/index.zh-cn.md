Welcome to the wonderful world of Kryptomon. Kryptomons are digital collectible pets built on the BSC<br> blockchain that can be bought using our dedicated BEP-20 token KMON. To be the best Kryptomon<br> trainer in the world you’ll need to care for your Kryptomons, train and breed them to create new<br> Kryptomons with exciting new traits and higher levels of power!<br> <br> Every Kryptomon has a unique but partially mutable genetic code made up of 38 different parameters<br> that will determine everything from its visual appearance to its prowess in combat. Much like a real pet,<br> your Kryptomons require attention and failure to provide this will see them “freeze” (simulated death)<br> and “unfreezing” them (simulated revival) will require the use of special items available on our<br> marketplace for a yet undefined amount of KMON.
