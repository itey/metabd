Legends Reborn is a strategic card game about building decks and taking on all challengers. Amass a collection of cards and creatures which allows you to build, re-build, and tweak decks to meet any challenge that comes your way.<br> <br> The game is a PVP-focused CCG set in a unique and distinctive fantasy world. Coming from the extremely experienced development team at Kung Fu Factory, the game features a lovely hand-drawn aesthetic, as well as a wide variety of heroes, creatures, and player-owned venues. Rich gameplay and in depth strategy offers robust and competitive gaming experience for all skill levels of CCG players.<br> The idea of player-owned land combines with NFT card ownership to create a revolutionary ecosystem where players have total control over not only their cards, but also the venues in which they compete.<br> <br> Tolkhiem is broken. The mighty have ravaged the land under the weight of war and conflict on an unimaginable scale, but in the wake of these hostilities, its people have learned to resolve their conflicts another way.<br> Gone are the days of warfare and destruction. Battles across Tolkhiem are no longer fought with sword and shield, but with coin, wit and the grace of the cards.<br> <br> Welcome to the Age of Chance!
