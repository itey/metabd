An online sci-fi/fantasy RTS set in the fictional Hermeian galaxy, Hash Rush sees players build, fight and trade their way to victory as they grow and manage their small mining colony, battle monsters, and trade valuable items and resources. Tasked with accumulating the much sought-after Crypto Crystals on their planet, successful players will earn themselves tokenized blockchain rewards as well as in-game items, bonuses and other prizes.
