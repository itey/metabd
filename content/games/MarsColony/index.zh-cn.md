It’s the beginning of the Colony on Mars, and the first settlers just claimed 21,000 unique land plots. On 129 Sol, Mars’s communication systems with Earth went off abruptly, and over 40% of the robots went out of control.<br> <br> It became apparent that it was the work of an AI who went rogue and planned to establish control over the Colony. Your role is to prevent AI from taking over the rest of the territory and help restore the peace.
