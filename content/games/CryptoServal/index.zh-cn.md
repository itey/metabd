CryptoServal is a game centered around breedable, collectible, and fighting creatures we call CryptoServals! Each animal is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by you; it cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed. Unlike in other hot potato games, each animal has a target price - when reached it becomes a boss and yields passive rewards for its owner.
