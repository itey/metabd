Monsta Infinite combines turn-based card battle system with match-three puzzle system to play a more competitive and interesting battling gameplay.‌<br> <br> Each Monsta team requires exactly 3 Monstas. Each Monsta have 6 card skills, 2 attack cards, and 2 defend cards. During a battle, players can choose from 5 cards in a randomly shuffled fashion. The player must drag the card to the designated target to apply it to an ally or an enemy. After each round, the player has 5 seconds to perform orbs dragging on the match three puzzle system. If the orbs matched are the respective class' color orb, then their skills can be enhanced. HP and MP orbs are special orb that recover Monsta's HP and MP.‌<br> <br> Battle initiative is decided from the difference in AGI and INT, which will determine the turn for each Monsta. Certain cards can affect the battle sequence and deny your opponents from making a move, which makes the battle more dynamic and test your wits!‌
