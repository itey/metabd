RobotWars is a Defense strategy game built on the BSC platform.<br> <br> Players get their robots via the opening of Rubics. To defend humanity, our Robot will fight the Destroyers in WARFARE and receive $WAR token.<br> <br> The Marketplace system will also allow for the purchase and trade of weapons, upgrades, and robot swaps.<br> <br> RobotWars employs a Play-to-Earn paradigm to generate WAR through games while also boosting the value of user NFTs with future features.<br> NFTs can be freely exchanged for WAR tokens on the market, which can subsequently be traded on exchanges or converted to fiat currency.<br> Currently, the player can begin earning using the following methods:<br> Use the Robot Warrior NFTs to protect the Earth against Destroyer's invasions and earn $WAR<br> Gathering Elements to increase the power of Robot Warriors and thus increase the payout per defense.<br> Collecting high ranked Robot Warriors, buy and sell them on Marketplace for $WAR.<br> Merging NFTs for stronger ROBOTs
