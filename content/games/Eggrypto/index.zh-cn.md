EGGRYPTO is the casual blockchain game using NFT and a public decentralized network for securing virtual gaming items and monsters.<br> <br> You can get new monsters by hatching eggs produced by a mini world tree. Very rarely, you can get rare monsters called Raremon. The amount of Raremon is hard capped and immutable on blockchain.<br> <br> In Quest, you make a party with monsters and battle with enemy monsters. You can get better reward including EXP, Gold and Monsters in the more difficult quests.
