D-Drops uses a tax on transactions to create valuable items such as boxes with cryptocurrencies, tokens, and NFT’s or any combination thereof and digitally drops it in the physical world. Holders can then use the DApp to locate these items and claim them. Users will also be able to create their own treasures by filling boxes and dropping them on the spot or another location of their choosing for others to collect.
