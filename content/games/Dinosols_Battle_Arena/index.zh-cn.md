Completely on-chain turn-based arena battle gameplay. <br> The gameplay is early access and should be viewed as our minimum viable product (MVP) as further improvements and enhancements are expected. <br> <br> The metadata embedded in your Dinosol informs the fighting abilities (e.g. attack, defense, agility, etc). <br> Initially, your Dinosol will be able to fight against a CPU but we expect to quickly enable battle gameplay against other Dinosol holders. <br> <br> In addition, we plan on hosting user versus user tournaments with prizes and awards.
