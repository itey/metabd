SolChicks! The Leading #1 Play-to-Earn Fantasy Game on Solana<br> <br> Our mission is simple: to be the leading fantasy NFT PvP and P2E gaming ecosystem on the Solana blockchain. We built our game around adorable SolChick NFT collectibles, where players use their SolChicks as their characters in a unique gaming metaverse.<br> <br> Driven by ExciInfinity's global gaming trend leadership, SolChicks also utilizes the Play-to-Earn function, which allows gaming activities to soon have an economic effect, to earn $SLC (Shares of Love) and It is a structure that can be compensated for $CHICKS. Utilization of $SLC and $CHICKS coins includes the purpose of breeding new SolChicks.<br> <br> Prior to the token launch, SolChicks attracted investment from more than 100 institutions and individual investors, and was listed on more than 15 popular launchpads such as Lightning launchpad, TrustPad, Game Station, Solster, and Lithium to $CHICKS. It will provide investment opportunities and is expected to have a listed market cap of $500m. 1st and 2nd wave currently sold out and is currently trading on over 7 exchanges.<br> <br> SolChicks currently has over 100,000 community users in 19 countries around the world.<br> <br> Most of the members of Solchicks game development team have experience in game development at global companies such as Nexon, NCsoft, Krafton, and Line Games, and have worked on major projects such as MapleStory, Dungeons &amp; Fighters, Aion, and Terra.<br> <br> SolChicks is a global project involving a total of 70 team members. Based on the provision of an optimized 3D graphic platform, PvP (Player versus Player) and PvE (Player versus Environment) methods are used to battle between NFT and character SolChick.
