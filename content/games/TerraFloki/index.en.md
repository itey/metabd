FLokiverse is the emerging strategic &amp; economic Play-to-Earn (P2E) Metaverse. <br> <br> Players participate through TerraFloki NFTs (characters and planets) and NFT Subscription. We fully expect this play-to-earn MMORPG to be a world- first in terms of its real-time responsiveness and integration with innovative TeFi strategies. <br> <br> You will be able to meet other Flokis there, converse with one another, play mini-games, and explore the world (trust us, it’s gonna be huge). <br> <br> Flokiverse is a multilayered experience. While the Arena is just one of many similar activities we’ll provide, this MMORPG is a more complex layer of the Flokiverse. <br> <br> Think of Flokiverse as GameFi and classic P2E combined. One will need an economical approach to maximize your income. The second element involves looting, hunting and throwing magic spells to grab some $fGOLD. The result of both will be the same. It starts with ‘crypto’ and ends with ‘gainz’. <br> <br> Remember that in both cases you play with the same character, the same Floki. MMO layer is being built on old and well-known Tibia engine, however it will be a completely different experience and also covered with an Economical layer that the original game never had.
