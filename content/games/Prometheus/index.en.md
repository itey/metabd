Prometheus creates themes based on the exchange, collision, and fusion of Eastern and Western myths. <br> In the painting style, we have chosen a painting method with a strong sense of line and color to express the gods in our hearts and the classic fighting forces of various countries. <br> We use this distinctive style to draw all games’ NFT, scene map, and UI design. This drawing method is frequently used in the “Final Fantasy” series. The overall style of the painting is based on the elements of the Japanese comic ACG popular painting style in recent years, adding a strong sense of comic lines, and the overall tone has an unparalleled memory point.<br> <br> The game Prometheus is a 5v5 NFT battle. In the game, there are two types of game play, PVE and PVP. <br> PVE combat between players and NPCs, which are primarily narrative battles and daily gameplay battles. <br> The other is PVP combat between players, mostly daily arena, significant events, and guild battles. <br> The fight is divided into two parts: pre-war planning and in-game decisions. Depending on their battle cards, pre-war players can pick between 1 and 5 combat units (some gameplay may require less than five combat units). <br> As a result, players must study the level’s criteria before selecting combat cards for various factions and generations.<br> The sequence of activities for all units in the current round is determined by the speed attribute of all units on the present battlefield at the start of each battle turn. Through the action axis, players may make strategic decisions such as whether to seize advantageous territory early in the conflict or assemble all forces to kill the enemy’s important role. Each little accurate decision will impact the overall condition of the war, allowing them to win in the end.<br> Players are awarded in-game tokens (WP) for winning PVP and PVE.
