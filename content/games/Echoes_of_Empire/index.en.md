Echoes of Empire is an epic sci-fi strategy game set within a galaxy at war. In game, players will be able to build, upgrade, and own a fleet of epic spaceships used to control their sector of the galaxy. Players will decide to go solo or join up in massive guilds to wage combat over the scarce resources circulating the system. Once they obtain enough resources they will need to muster and master the economic centers of their Command Station where they can upgrade warships, craft new weapons, and repair their fleet. Player ownership of in-game assets is a central mechanic, and players will have the ability to own major sectors of the galactic system. What kind of galactic warlord are you? Find out in Echoes of Empire!
