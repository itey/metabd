VOX<br> The adorable new collectible series from Gala Labs.<br> <br> Own, trade, play and earn with your unique NFT character – each has their own look, job and personality.<br> <br> Each VOX is a unique ERC721, with provably randomised traits, true to their character. The inaugural series will only ever have 8,888 characters.<br> <br> Everyone can purchase a VOX for 0.0888ETH. Rarities will start to be revealed when 50% of VOX have been sold.<br> <br> When you own a VOX you will get the FBX file so you can animate and play with them in the metaverse.<br> <br> The best bit – you can stake GALA and by playing with your VOX earn VOXcoin. The amount is directly related to how rare they are and how much you play.<br> <br> TOTALLY RANDOM<br> Each VOX starts with the selection of a class, and from there, the traits appropriate for that class get iterated. Data is then compared to all other existing VOX to ensure it is unique.
