Open platform with no objectives. Built by players, owned by players. Explore, craft, build, trade.<br> <br> In the Mega World Intro you’re able to walk the streets of the MegaCryptoPolis, step inside buildings, where new players will receive their missions in Alpha, check basic interiors to be soon available for decoration, visit your neighbors, use the public transportation system. Check the new Main Tower lobby and the perfect example of a custom building - The Fellowship Towers.<br> <br> MEGA WORLD<br> A world, where every item is produced and thus owned by a player. A virtual city, where every land plot belongs to, and every building is constructed by a player. And what is even most important, every item can be freely traded between players, just like tools required to craft an item could be produced from other items or purchased on the open market. <br> <br> We invite you to a brave new world, where it’s all about the players to shape the landscape and the economics on the scarce gaming map. In the Metaverse, you can be whoever you want, live your best life - no strings attached.
