Demole is the first playable 3D RPG game in the NFT ecosystem. This game offers an immersive gaming experience with a rich storyline and epic 3D animation, along with a perfected earning mechanism based on blockchain. This is an optimum channel for 3D game and play-to-earn investment platform.<br> <br> 3D Design &amp; Animation<br> Unlike most other games on the NFT market, Demole is designed with realistic 3D graphics, vivid and smooth animations, with eye-catching and epic combat effects.<br> Available on both PC &amp; Mobile<br> Most current NFT titles require players to access a PC platform or a website. This will be a significant impediment to the game’s mobility because gamers/investors cannot access the game regularly to check up on their accounts/characters.<br> Understanding this point, we have brought Demole to both PC and mobile platforms so that you can play anytime and anywhere with your smartphone.<br> Play to Earn<br> With a massive gameplay and mechanics system in both PvP and PvE modes, Demole promises to be the most attractive play-to-earn game for both gamers and crypto investors. The game is expected to outperform previous names on the market.<br> <br> Burning + Revenue Sharing<br> One of the exclusive features of Demole is the Burning Token feature — which increases the value of the tokens of the players who own them.<br> If Burning benefits investors, then Demole’s revenue redistribution will greatly benefit gamers. As the total number of players increases, the reward for each player is also increased accordingly without having to compete to enter the staking pool.
