Plato Farm is an NFT farming operation game based on the HECO Smart Chain. The fun starts when the player acquires a small farm, then raises animals and plants crops, harvesting MARK and PLATO tokens in a casual gaming atmosphere. These tokens and other various NFT items can be used to turn the originally barren land into beautiful, rich villages and cities. Players can also establish their own in-game guilds, allowing them to earn and play at the same time!
