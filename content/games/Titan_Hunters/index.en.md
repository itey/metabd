TITAN HUNTERS is inspired by fun gameplay of Diablo, Voxel’s signature look and the feel of Minecraft. It is a creative and unique game project that combines NFT (Earning Nature) and the best gaming genre of MMORPG (Fun Nature).<br> <br> In TITAN HUNTERS, you can become a hunter and discover secrets in an exciting world of miracles and mysteries. Gamers can also participate in epic battles to fight angry and cunning monster bosses – Titans. Hunt alone or team up with other players and use materials collected from fallen foes to craft new gear and take on even bigger, badder Titan!<br> <br> We believe that fun gameplay and the opportunity to own unique NFTs are the best way to reward and engage users.
