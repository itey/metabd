We grew up playing Defense games, with that in mind we wanted to create something with incredible gameplay and add the powerful Blockchain technology. <br> <br> Satashi Monsters(SSM) was born that way, It all starts in the world of NewHera, a fantastic world with species that lived in harmony. As time went by, magical creatures began to appear and upset the planet's balance, forcing more and more residents to live in villages or closed kingdoms. Your job is to prevent the arrival of enemy hours at different points on the map, for that you have more than 100 types of towers and different abilities.
