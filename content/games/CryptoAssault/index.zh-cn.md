Use Ethereum to buy units on the blockchain! Every unit is a unique, tradeable ERC-721 NFT token. Purchase units from our Early bird Sale below and get a headstart on building your army. Units can be combined together to form more powerful units. They also will not be destroyed if they die in battle! They will just go back to your inventory to be repaired for a few hours.<br> <br> Enter a huge 3D world with thousands of players. Units will be moving in real-time to capture territory, mine resources and battle other units. Units from your inventory will start at the edge of the map. A unit must refuel for 3 hours after every move and has a max distance that it can travel at a time. Ground units will need to avoid water, trees, mountains and other ground units while aerial units will be able to fly over most obstacles.<br> <br> Not all land is created equal! The world is divided into rings. As you travel towards the center, each ring contains more valuable land and the satellite also has an increased chance of landing there. You'll need to increase your units' star-rating to access the inner rings. Fusing 3 units of the same type will increase its star-rating. Also, older units will collect more land rewards.
