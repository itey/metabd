A whole new Blockchain play-to-earn Car Game experience with awesome Voxelized Cars.<br> <br> With the Introduction of the Racing Game and later Development of the game a whole game economy is planned. We have a lot of great ideas to have a fully decentralized economy, our own game currency, custom garages and lands owned by players with great revenues opportunities, and much more. <br> <br> “The Racing Game” can be considered a Strategy Card Game with some TCG elements that will make a fun yet challenging experience for all kinds of players.<br> <br> 1- In order to play, you must possess a Hash Garage NFT Car in your linked wallet.<br> <br> 2- Build an “AI Modules” Deck from your lot of “AI Modules” Cards (Optional, but highly recommended).<br> <br> 3- Select the race you want to participate from the ones available (It indicates the track, but the current conditions will be a surprise) and pay the entry fee if required to that race.<br> <br> 4- The Race starts, play your best strategy and see who wins!
