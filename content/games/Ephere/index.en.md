Ephere is a football game where people can earn cryptocurrency through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. It consists of two layers; The base layer is a scarce collection of carefully designed NFTs with football-related skills that can be improved and visuals that can be personalized. On top of it, thereâ€™s a football-management simulation game that uses those NFTs to provide a fun play-to-earn gaming experience.
