Block Ape Scissors aims to become a Blockchain ecosystem that creates multiple revenue models in dynamic and fun environments. These environments are expected to integrate NFTs (non-fungible tokens) into a Play-to-Earn 2.0 system. In the Block Ape Scissors ecosystem, holders of cryptocurrency tokens own a part of a decentralised company and earn part of the revenue the company makes.
