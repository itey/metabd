In WEO, you control a hero in a world with thousands of other players with roaming monsters and valuable resources to gather. We opted for an overhead view with a simple point-and-click interface similar to MOBAs like League of Legends. <br> A dynamic world changes as players work together to unlock new areas, events and dungeons. During their time, players will encounter many different types of monsters, raid bosses and PvP battles. <br> Not all heroes will be ideal in every situation. WEO is all about preparation. <br> <br> That means bringing the right heroes, wearing the right gear and drinking the right potions is key. If a boss summons 100 water elementals, then bringing a hero with a fire AoE will be sure to help.<br> <br> At its heart, WEO is a hero collector. There will be 40+ heroes to collect at launch and players can switch to any hero as long as they are not in combat. Every hero has 4 skills (although some extremely rare versions might have more!) and a set of random traits. Even 2 heroes of the same type will have some major differences.<br> <br> Heroes can greatly increase their stats by absorbing other heroes and their traits. We call this hero ascension. Certain traits will be highly valued on certain heroes which will increase their rarity and become highly sought after NFTs. We’ll be writing a full article on hero ascension later.<br> <br> Craft Everything<br> Players will acquire all sorts of materials by killing monsters and gathering resources. These materials are used to create the items that are used in the game. Almost everything in WEO is crafted from monster loot and resources. Some of the things that can be crafted by players are:<br> <br> - Gear that heroes wear<br> - Potions that temporarily enhance heroes<br> - Breeding pets for gathering resources<br> <br> To ensure a vibrant economy where resources are constantly consumed, these things can never be found and always must be crafted.
