The CryptoZoons are tasked with fighting the Yaki Monsters every day. The player first selects the creatures to use in battle and equips them with weapons by purchasing these items available in the MarketPlace. The player will pay a little BNB gas price to engage in combat with a chosen enemy.<br> The stronger the enemy, the greater the reward.
