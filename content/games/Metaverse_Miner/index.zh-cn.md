HOW TO PLAY<br> Step 1: Be a Star Master or Star Lord<br> <br> Become a Star Master: To participate in the auction of Planet NFT, you can get the whole planet’s territory and become a Star Master. What you will get then is a certain number of Miner NFT that come from the planet, and meanwhile the Planet NFT will keep generating Miner NFT. But only the Miner NFT can participate in $META mining. Auction will be initiated in the Metaverse Alliance, the number of Planet NFT is limited, and users who can auction NFT first will have the most chance to enter the field first!<br> <br> Become a Star Lord: If you don’t auction the Planet NFT, you can only get the Miner NFT from the Planet NFT or trade in the secondary market.<br> <br> Step 2: Buy or Sell the Miner NFT<br> <br> Miner NFT is equivalent to mining rigs, buying a machine before we can mine. The Planet NFT will continue to produce Miner NFT, users can only use USDT to buy Miner NFT “blind box”, randomly get different Miner NFT. Each Miner NFT on Planet NFT is not only can be in the planet mining, therefore, Star Master should maintain the relationship with the Star Lord, or they will take Miner NFT “leave”.<br> <br> Step 3: Deposit USDT to Buy “Energy Value”<br> <br> Miner NFT mining requires “energy value”, which is to top up USDT (equivalent to the electricity you buy mining machines to mine) to buy. Users need to top up this “energy value” in advance before mining. The use of “energy value” will be prompted, “energy value” will also be prompted before it is consumed, and when the “energy value” is insufficient, mining will not be possible.<br> <br> Step 4: Stake the Miner NFT to Collect Energy<br> <br> After user has staked the miner NFT to the planet, the terminal controller will be placed on the original planet to continuously obtain “energy” $META.<br> <br> 5% of the $META mined by the player-owned Miner NFT can be owned by the Star Master(Planet owner) and 95% by the Miner NFT owner.<br> <br> Additional: Lease the Star Master’s Mining Area to Earn
