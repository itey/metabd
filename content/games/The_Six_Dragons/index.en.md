The Six Dragons is a feature-rich, fantasy Open World RPG inspired by some the most iconic titles of the past two decades. The game features a 64 km2-long vibrant world with limitless adventures, epic fights, and the freedom to do anything you want. Players can explore endless lands, farm for valuable materials, craft more than 300 unique items, trade items with other players and improve their arsenal using powerful enchants.<br> <br> What makes this experience unique is that almost all items in the game are decentralised, using the power of innovative blockchain technology. That means players truly own their game assets as they can freely trade them with other players, sell them for real-world value, and use across different game universes. <br> <br> The Six Dragonsâ€™ vision is to be a game where players are the ultimate protagonists as they constantly shape the game but can also capture value from their achievements. We are building a gaming world for diverse players, with the aspiration to allow the community adopt various gameplay roles and freely run a decentralized, player-owned economy.
