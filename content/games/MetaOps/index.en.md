Put your tactical skills to the test with Meta Ops, the first NFT based first-person shooter. Players will be able to advance their characters, level up their weapons, and earn points to redeem mystery boxes. Mystery Boxes contain Meta Ops NFTs! <br> <br> As a beta release, you will be able to play 6v6 team deathmatches. The initial release will include “the factory” meta ops very first map, 32+ primary and secondary weapons, tactical equipment, and more. However, in stage 4 of our roadmap, we will be releasing game modes, such as capture the flag, search and destroy, free for all, throwing knife dodgeball, and knife-only hide and seek.<br> <br> We are bridging the gap by creating a metaverse through first-person shooter gaming. Be a part of our interactive Meta Ops Base where you can create your own bunker, hang out with other players, show off your NFT collection, and enter portals to Meta Ops gameplay.<br> <br> Our 2000 Beta Pass NFTs will be released through Immutable X on December 15th for .05 ETH. Follow us on Twitter and stay tuned on our Discord for more information.
