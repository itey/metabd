Economic Simulator<br> Explore, look for opportunities, rent, buy, invest and sell in the largest capitalist game in the world, where the main goal is to generate as much revenue as possible and expand your business exponentially.<br> You will start from scratch and build up the greatest real-estate empire that the world has ever seen.<br> <br> Actions and Currency<br> Currently, the Off-Chain Economy consists of four main actions: Build, Rent, Upgrade and Sell.<br> The game currency works the same On and Off-Chain. There are four categories:<br> Cash: the most basic and used Off-Chain game currency.<br> Gold: only available through In-App-Purchases or by completing Businesses Objectives.<br> XP (experience): produced by finishing Upgrades in rented Businesses and completing Business Objectives. XP also accumulates over time, increasing the Level of the Headquarters.<br> Management Capacity (MC): generated automatically by Branches and increases by upgrading owned Branches. <br> <br> The Virtuous Cycle<br> Renting Businesses gives you MC and soft cash; this will allow you to invest in upgrades that will provide you with XP, more cash, and MC. Consequently, this will level up your HQ and offer you MC, cash, and the possibility to build new Branches. As a result, you will receive more XP and cash so you can Rent even more Businesses. This way, the loop continues, allowing you to build your real estate empire. Additionally, you will have a chance to speed up this process by using Gold (hard cash).
