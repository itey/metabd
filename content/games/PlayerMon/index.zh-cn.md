Playermon is a boundless NFT Game where anyone can explore and battle in the universe with their favorite Playermons! Players are able to colonize planets, earn resources, and battle other players with their playermons.‌<br> Players can earn/breed playermon through breeding or purchasing eggs.‌<br> The key difference between Playermon and a traditional game is that Blockchain economic design is used to reward our players for their contributions to the ecosystem. This new model of gaming has been dubbed “play to earn”.<br> <br> Players can earn by:<br> - Competing in PVP battles to win leaderboard prizes.<br> - Breeding pets and selling them on the marketplace.<br> - Collecting and speculating on rare playermon<br> - Building space colonial base<br> - Farming for the gems that are needed to breed mon.
