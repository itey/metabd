The Galaxy Fight Club (GFC) is a cross-brand, cross-platform PvP MOBA game where players can battle, win and earn ethereum &amp; nfts.<br> <br> The Galaxy Fight Club (GFC) is not just an avatar project, it is a real-time PvP MOBA game that brings together all the other different avatar collections onto one single platform. <br> <br> When you think about Super Smash Bros, what makes it so fun is that you have characters from different IP’s coming together, like a Pikachu fighting a Mario. Galaxy Fight Club is doing the same thing, you will see a Bull from Bulls on the Block fighting an Ape from BAYC, or a Cool Cat fighting with a Cryptopunk.
