World War III…but not the way you think. This time, the women are doing the fighting…and these chicks don’t care if they break a nail or smudge some makeup.<br> These are bombshells who drop bombs…vixens who are in long-term relationships with their sniper rifles…femme fatales who would rather infiltrate enemy bases than watch a romantic comedy.<br> Pinupwarlords is a fun and fast-paced Play to earn NFT trading card game fully onchain, with stunning ART and multi-PvP modes. It’s a game where players own the assets and can freely resell them and participate in its ecosystem.
