Peakmines is a blockchain-based Play to Earn mining game, running on the Binance Smart Chain, which has a native BEP-20 token called PEAK, used for the entire internal economy.<br> In Peakmines your workers collect several minerals that once refined can be exchanged for $PEAK tokens as well as you can use them to forge various jewels that will increase their value.
