What is a Parallel? What does Parallel have to do with NFTs?<br> A Parallel is one of the five streams of evolution that humans have undergone simultaneously. They are the Earthen, Marcolian, Augencore, Kathari and Shroud.<br> <br> Your purchase consists of original 3D art of a character or artifacts rendered by the artist. Each piece is represented by an NFT “Non Fungible Token” on the Ethereum network. The purchase of this NFT is subject to our terms of service.<br> <br> The Parallel game is composed of digital collectible cards which can be used to build a deck of cards and played in a online / mobile game *In Development*<br> <br> By purchasing this original digital art as an NFT you are supporting the Parallel project. As with anyone supporting an early-stage project, by purchasing the NFT art you accept the risk that the project may experience changes, delays and unforeseen challenges and acknowledge that aspects of the project may not come to fruition.<br> <br> What do you need to play the Parallel online game?<br> You will need to collect a minimum set of cards to compose a playable deck of cards that is associated with one of the five Parallels.<br> <br> You can create more than 1 deck of cards, and play as any of the Parallels for each match.<br> <br> Mix and match cards from the same Parallel to compose more powerful decks for play.<br> <br> Do I need all Parallels to play?<br> You will need at least one complete deck of cards for one Parallel that you want to play as. You can collect cards from multiple Parallels and have multiple decks so you can choose which Parallel to play as for each match. Universal cards can be used alongside any of the Parallels.
