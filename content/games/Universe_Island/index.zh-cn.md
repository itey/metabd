The Universe Island is a third-person mobile shooter game with NFT integration and an underlying story. In the Universe Island, players will experience story-driven action, cryptocurrency rewards and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) equipment progression.<br> <br> The Story is set in the metaverse, which is fractured into islands. The main protagonist of the Story is the metaverse itself, with characters to explore its secrets. Each island has its mysteries and will be launched with an animated TV Show to support the narrative.
