Hash Warfare is a 3D ARPG chain game based on the block-chain. It employs Defi and NFT technology to make the crypto world accessible to hundreds and thousands of gamers. For the first time, players are able to actually “own” their game assets. Players can use their tradeable NFT cards to experience the PVE mode, PVP mode, and even fight bosses with other players of their guild.
