In the world of Tales of Angels, the Gods seek to keep the peace from the enemy attacks generated by evil spirits and demons that have emerged from the underworld to steal mythical objects that belong to the Gods. With these, they could increase their power much more.<br> <br> The Adventure will be the one primary source of income in the game. Each player will have to think accordingly to their NFT elements and status to successfully complete the map chosen. There will be 4 types of maps which. Each one will have a level of rarity so each God can farm in it.<br> <br> Dungeons are the second form of farming inside the game. This mode, in particular will have higher rewards than the Adventure mode, and the items drop rate will be rarer than the adventure. Dungeons will require three times more energy than adventure mode.
