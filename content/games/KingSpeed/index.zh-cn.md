KingSpeed is a Free-to-play and Play-to-earn blockchain-based racing game where players use NFT cars and equipment to challenge other players in a huge and ever-expanding racing world that we created. In KingSpeed, users can collect rare virtual items including Cars, Drivers, Gears and Race Tracks. Furthermore, they can use their collectibles to race in our racing games. The design of the collectible components of the game simulates traditional scarcity-based collecting games. Our racing game will contain multiple game modes and activities, allowing users to earn rewards while playing the game. <br> Our aim is to combine both Free-to-play and Play-and-earn models into our gaming system, allowing everyone to start playing the Kingspeed game without having to pay a large amount of money to acquire NFTs at the beginning. We give all users the ability to claim and use a simple &amp; generic NFT car with the same basic stats, although NFT cars that are more unique or in special collections will have more advantages than the free, generic NFT cars.<br> All users that own Kingspeed collectibles and play the game can earn benefits by: <br> - Complete simple daily quests and earn rewards <br> - Collect in-game drops such as loot-boxes, you are able to open or sell them on marketplace<br> - Win in time trial mode<br> - Win in multiplayer race matches<br> - Winn in 1-1 race matches <br> - Win in race tournaments and events<br> - Stake to receive rewards <br> - Rent your car <br> - Predict the result
