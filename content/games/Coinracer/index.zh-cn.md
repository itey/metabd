Welcome to Coinracer, crypto's first, and only, OpenGL racing game; where your skill dictates your rewards, not probability or pre-calculated formulas. Hop in your personal NFT racecar, grab your steering wheel (keyboard and mouse), and get ready to hit the track to earn crypto rewards in this amazing 3D racing game!<br> <br> How it works: upon entering the race, participants contribute a set amount of tokens to be locked inside of a smart contract. These contributions are then redistributed among the winners of the race as a prize pool. Creating a competitive eSport-influenced environment for novice and professional racers alike.<br> <br> Focusing on a personalized experience, regular NFT drops will be announced - allowing players to purchase a variety of racecars, accessories, and cosmetic designs. These collectibles truly immerse each and every racer in the game - making your collection uniquely yours, and another potential means of earning within the Coinracer ecosystem.
