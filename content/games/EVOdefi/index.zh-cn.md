Every weekend we will hold Monsters Tournament with a USDC prize pool.<br> <br> First three winners of each arena will share 50% of the prize pool, the rest 50% of the pool will be shared in 7+ level arena.<br> Register to the Tournament, perform at least 3 attacks and be one of the top 3 players to get USDC prize!<br> <br> To register you need 3 special NFTs that you can get in daily battles Monday to Friday. Daily battles arenâ€™t fatal for your monsters unlike on tournaments where you might lose them forever. If you missed daily battles you can buy tournament tickets NFT on the NFT Marketplace when ready!
