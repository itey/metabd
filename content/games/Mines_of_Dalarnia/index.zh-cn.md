Mines of Dalarnia is a free-to-play blockchain action-adventure platform-mining game where the player controls a character and guides them through a level (plot), mining through various blocks of earth, to discover and collect minerals of multiple rarities. Delve into the unknown, dark mine, collect minerals and use them to upgrade the character through mining equipment and character attributes. Buy or rent plots of land. Earn money when you rent out your mines to other players.
