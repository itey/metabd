Blockchain Monster Hunt is the world’s first multi-chain game that runs entirely on the blockchain itself. Inspired by Pokémon-GO, BCMH allows players to continuously explore brand-new locations on the blockchain to hunt and battle monsters. Each block on the blockchain is a unique digital space where a limited number of Monsters (of the same DNA gene and rarity) may exist. Players and collectors can hunt or battle for a chance to capture these unique Monsters and to earn coins.<br> <br> "A Game that Runs Entirely on the Blockchain"<br> Monsters are created in conjunction with new blocks on the blockchain, and the attributes of each new monster are based purely on the unique digital fingerprint of a specific block (i.e. the blockhash). This means that no one can predict or control the appearance and attributes of the monsters. Furthermore, this means that the size of the BCMH universe grows with the blockchain itself. As no one can predict the blockhash before the block is mined, no one (not even the game developers) have control over the monster world.<br> These factors make the Blockchain Monsters a unique species that live on the blockchain, and make BCMH go beyond the concept of a simple NFT ownership system that is incorporated in most of the current NFT games in the market.<br> <br> "The First Ever Multi-chain NFT Game"<br> Blockchain Monster Hunt brings a thrilling new experience where players can play the game on multiple chains and are in fact encouraged to interact between them. For example, Water Elemental Monsters are only available on Ethereum and Fire Elemental Monsters are only available on Binance Smart Chain. If players want Water Elemental Monsters to cool down Fire Elemental Monsters in battle, they must trade or transfer Monsters across chains.
