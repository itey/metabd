A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Rare Eggs System - est. 2017 CryptoBeasts delivers a unique token with novel utility. [..] The $rare-eggs token has a finite supply of 10,000. Each token is [one] of 1,000 beasts of ten different types (species). After a period of incubation, the token holder can ‘hatch’ their $rare-egg [...] revealing their CryptoBeast and associated attributes/rarities. The $rare-egg also comes with a property lot in ‘Eggland’ - the setting of the CryptoBeasts video game.
