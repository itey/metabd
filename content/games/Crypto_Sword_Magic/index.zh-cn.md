Crypto Sword &amp; Magic is a traditional RPG game that raises heroes and challenges new dungeons. Data of all heroes, equipment, and pets are recorded on the blockchain, and the game logic works on the Smart Contract. Even when you are not playing the game, you can always play with others in a mercenary mode.
