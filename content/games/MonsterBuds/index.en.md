In the year 2021 a meteor drops down on one of the most exclusive cannabis fields that ever existed. These fields brought joy to thousands of people with concerts, special get togethers, and some of the best buds you have ever encountered. After the meteor strike something very strange occurred. The ooze from the meteor created a monsterous bud mutation which spawned …<br> <br> MONSTERBUDS<br> <br> WHAT IS THIS?<br> MonsterBuds are breedable cannabis-inspired NFTs that utilize a unique naming convention to explore the realm of fictional strains in addition to a few very rare, real strains added in the makeup. You'll be able to buy, sell, breed and smoke these Buds.<br> <br> MINTING AND FUNCTIONALITY<br> There will be 10,420 unique, hand-drawn, and programmatically generated Buds that will be available to mint for 0.070874 ETH (iykyk). Each MonsterBuds will be completely different and comprised of up to 8 attributes and 8 monster parts with further in-game utility. These will be assigned in a trustless manner with our exclusive custom built algorithm. Utilizing current on-chain technologies, we’re able to generate special edition MonsterBuds as we create partnerships. Some of the partnerships already include but are not limited to: the cannabis and music industries, special guest artists and musicians, and top brands.<br> <br> SMOKING<br> Smoking a MonsterBud will be the equivalent of a like button. We will utilize this for contests and weekly prizes for the most-smoked Buds. We have also discussed internally, to use these mechanics for earning breeds back. For example, by smoking a Bud 3 times in a row, a user can earn a breed. Smoking will have a 420 minute cooldown period.<br> <br> CHARACTERISTICS<br> There are three species of MonsterBuds - Sativas, Indicas, and Hybrids. Each species will include these master characteristics: THC Amount, CBD Amount, Master Color.
