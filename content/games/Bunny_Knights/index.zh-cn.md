Bunny Knights is a non-fungible token (NFT) project created on the Tezos network through the Hic et Nunc platform (A big marketplace where artists can sell and buy digital goods like images, videos and music)<br> <br> The main proposal of this project is to produce 500 unique medieval-fantasy bunnies in pixel-art. In the collection you will see bunny knights, bunny warriors, bunny archers, bunny mages and all kind of classes from RPGs (And yes, all of them have stats like level, strength, agility and more!).<br> <br> DO THEY HAVE REAL UTILITY?<br> When someone buys an NFT, he or she could have interest in the art itself, in your functionality (e.g: like an item for boost your character inside a game) or as an investment purpose.<br> <br> When you buy a Bunny Knights, for sure you can have one of these objectives in mind or all of them together: collect bunnies for fun (aren't they cute?), using them as an investment strategy (Bunny Knights get more valuable over the time!) and use them as a key to access an interactive project that is being prepared. It's up to you!
