Immersys.io is a multiplayer 3D multiverse which allows players to fully immerse themselves into a virtual world. Immersys is playable both on Windows PC and in Virtual Reality (Disabled Currently). In Immersys, players are provided a world where digital ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens is rewarded through in-game utility. This utility can range from NFTs acting as verifiable account logins, ticketing, and admission to exclusive areas and content, wearable cosmetic items, applications on the Immersys Virtual Interface, and so much more. Immersys aims to bring value to all collectors, creators, and the entire WAX ecosystem. This means collectible NFTs like art, music, and videos can be showcased and interactive.<br> <br> At the heart of the Immersys multiverse is our Immersys Virtual Interface. This Immersys Virtual Interface comes packed with a full suite of stock virtual applications. Immersys has its own app store called Apps, which contains free &amp; paid vApps which require ownership of a NFT to use. These vApps enable players to interact with the Immersys world, other players, NFTs, and Fungible Tokens(FT). The combination of NFT items that are on the WAX blockchain, our FATE token, and the utility given to them via the Immersys virtual world is our approach to creating the new digital world. A digital world where players play, earn, and own.<br> <br> We want Immersys to be a massively multiplayer online game! We also don’t want to be just one genre of game either. Our “play-to-earn” aspects, will occur through players participating in various activities within the Immersys multiverse. The world we’re making is going to be BIG!
