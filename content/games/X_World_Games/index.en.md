X World Games is the next-generation decentralized blockchain game ecosystem. "X World" represents an unknown universe to be explored, and "Games" represents more games that will be added to this ecosystem. The vision of X World Games is to build a diversified gaming ecosystem that connects traditional game players and the blockchain world and help more game developers who want to enter the crypto space to create the underlying blockchain framework.
