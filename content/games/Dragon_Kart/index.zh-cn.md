Dragon Kart is a 3D racing e-sport game built on the Blockchain platform, with the characters in the game taken from a Pikalong series by a Vietnamese well-known artist named Thang Fly. Players can participate in dramatic races, and use their superior driving skills to earn various rewards and tokens from hard-earned victories. Gameplay of Dragon Kart is considered as a "arena" of life and death when it requires players to combine their driving skills with the use of individual character skills. In addition, on each track there will be “mystery boxes” with which participants will be allowed to receive a new weapon to help gain an advantage and win races.<br> <br> You will not be alone on each of your own tracks since you can invite friends or family to race, play and earn rewards together. Dragon Kart is developed on Unity 3D technology with the most advanced game backend system that ensures connecting more than 100,000 different races taking place at the same time, giving you a smooth and best game experience. All you need to do is practice your driving skills to the best of your ability, memorize the tracks, study the skills of each character and come up with the right strategy for each race to win.
