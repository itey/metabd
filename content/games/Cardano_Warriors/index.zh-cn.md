The game Cardano Warriors was born from our love of video games, our technology enthusiasm and the idea of making a real difference in the Non-fungible Token (NFT) projects scenery during the early Cardano Network stages.<br> <br> We focused on bringing an unique and exclusive art collection during the first stage, celebrating the Golden Era console RPG video games that were made in eight and sixteen bits. <br> <br> Our collection brought value to its parties, moving an entire buying and selling NFTs economy. We are now working on bringing even more value to our initial collection. <br> <br> The Cardano Warriors goal is to become an exploring and adventure game that has RPG elements, running on the Cardano blockchain technology. <br> <br> We are a team full of experienced developers and we are confident that we are building an excellent project to deliver to the community.<br> <br> To all of our followers and future players who are thrilled with the first phase release: the game is only starting!<br> <br> Welcome, everyone and, please, enjoy!
