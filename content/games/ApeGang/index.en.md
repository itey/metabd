STORY<br> Hidden in their wild jungle, apes have watched human life in a nearby area for centuries. All of their habits, expressions, attires, ways of life / working / transport... apes studied everything in detail.<br> <br> The time finally came for apes to fully take over an entire city and replace humans once and for all. They have settled in several territories in Ape City, which resulted in the formation of multiple gangs: good guys, bad guys, crazy guys, chilled guys, weird guys, scary guys... and even more !<br> <br> Each gang is now fighting to take control of Ape City and become the undisputed leader - which one will you join ?
