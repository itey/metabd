CryptoFights is a turn-based combat game where players can choose, build and utilize various skills to inflict damage on their opponents. Not only is your ability to strike powerfully with impressive weapons a factor, but also your ability to hide, dodge, cast spells, and more.<br> <br> Players and spectators can place bets on the outcomes of fights, making a winning character more valuable as time goes on. Ownership of game items is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain and they can be traded on Kronoverse’s marketplace. On top of that, the blockchain also stores all past fight moves and results—allowing for greater transparency, replays of any past fight, and detailed analysis of each battle.
