WHAT IS AVAXTARS?<br> AVAXTARS is an NFT based browser game build on the Avalanche Blockchain Platform. It has its own Tokenomics based on $AVXT, $DGC and $ENXT Tokens.<br> <br> WHO ARE AVAXTARS?<br> Every Avaxtar is a digitally generated avatar. Images of Avaxtars are saved on IPFS and their existence is recorded on Avalanche Mainnet as unique ERC-721 Tokens. To create an Avaxtar we are using a digital genetic code (DGC) and we create a hash value of these genes, so we guarantee that all Avaxtars are different from each other.<br> <br> WHAT CAN I DO WITH MY AVAXTARS?<br> Creating an Avaxtar is just a beginning of a great adventure. If you like your Avaxtar you can keep it as long as you want to be bounded as an ERC-721 Token to your Metamask wallet.<br> <br> Avaxtars Roadmap<br> Phase 1 started on March 31, 2021<br> Players generated new Avaxtars by covering their costs. Those Avaxtars are Generation 1 (Gen1) and the maximum amount of Gen1 Avaxtars that can be generated is 10.000. All Gen1 are generated and minting ended.<br> <br> Phase 2 started on June 14, 2021<br> Players are able to purchase a “Personal Avaxtar Generation Machine (PAGM)” with $AVXT Tokens. PAGM device can generate new Gen2 Avaxtars and players can farm $AVXT.<br> <br> In Phase 3, all Avaxtars can go to missions, gain experience, and reach new levels.
