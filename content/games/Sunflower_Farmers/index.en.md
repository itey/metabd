Plant, Craft &amp; Earn at Sunflower Farmers - The only blockchain game where the community controls the tokens, NFTs and resources.<br> <br> Play to Earn the in-game ERC20 SFF Token which can be used for crafting recipes, mining resources and growing your farm.<br> <br> The game has a built-in supply &amp; demand mechanism that controls the underlying tokenomics. The aim is to reward farmers who are early to the game and drive scarcity. When the total supply increases, the rewards received will lessen. Those who hustle early are rewarded greatly for their efforts.<br> <br> Farmers have the ability to mine ERC20 resources and craft ERC721 recipes that are designed and curated by the community.<br> <br> Natural token reflection and distributed rewards for long term holders of the token.<br> <br> No presale or over-promising bullshit. The team has a track record of delivering features that matter.
