Play to Earn, with a twist!<br> <br> Thunder Run is a Play to Airdrop (P2A) interactive game, starring Chad Thundercock as the main character and integrated into the blockchain with our governance token: $THUNDRR.<br> <br> This token is used by players to upgrade their characters and increase player attributes in store, ultimately increasing the ability of your character within the game. This is useful to note when competing in our Player vs Player Mode for a chance to rank on the weekly leaderboard and be Airdropped Cash Prizes in our Governance Token. <br> <br> The top 10 players of each weeks gameplay will receive governance token airdrops to their blockchain wallets (proportional to leaderboard position). The game will be constantly developed with new characters, challenges, levels, in-store character upgrades and much more!
