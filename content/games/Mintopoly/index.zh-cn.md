Play Mintopoly – the global play-to-earn blockchain simulator game for crypto tycoons! Backed by NFT Mintopoly Cards and weekly crypto airdrops, see why 15,000+ players have competed to become the ultimate "Mintopolist" and win NFT prizes.<br> <br> Crypto simulator game<br> The heart of Mintopoly! is a free-to-play crypto-based idle game. Open your dashboard, launch your first mining rig, and build your empire of smart contracts, exchanges, trading bots, and more. Compete on the global leaderboard to earn the most 'Mintopoly! coins' and win real NFT cards and cryptocurrency as prizes!<br> <br> Collectable NFT cards<br> Powering Mintopoly! is a limited edition of 12,000 collectable NFT 'Mintopoly! cards' that each provide unique boosts inside the game to help you rank higher. These are being steadily minted and dropped in small batches. Plus, each round includes several challenges to win free cards – finish with the highest net worth and you'll win the ultra-rare mintopolist card! <br> <br> crypto airdrop rewards<br> We developed our own cryptocurrency [Mintopoly! Money] with a unique twist: it is distributed freely to players of the game. The top ~250 players in each weekly round receive an airdrop of these tokens in proportion to the amount they earned. PLUS you can use these earnings [later this year] to mint your own limited-edition NFT cards!
