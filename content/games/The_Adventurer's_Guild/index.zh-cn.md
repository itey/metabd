The Adventurer's Guild is a NFT-based RPG developed by SixPM Software, and powered by the WAX Blockchain. You can create a character, deck them out in gear, and embark on quests, ranging from dungeon crawls to fights against powerful bosses, all from Discord! <br> <br> Defeating foes and completing quests will earn you rewards, in the form of Loot Chests that can be opened for NFTs, and $GUILD, a WAX token that serves as the currency of The Adventurer's Guild.
