Central to the DPK platform are Kreatties and their offspring. Kreatties are NFTs that act as vouchers for logging on to the platform. All 7000 Kreatty NFTs of the DPK platform have been sold out and will no longer be released.<br> <br> Among the benefits that come with holding them is accessing all subsequent games. You can also create clans which are communities sharing hash rates. The clan shares profits equally.<br> <br> DPK has two major tokens. The first is the DPK token, which is the platform’s governance token; the second – KIT token – is its utility token.<br> <br> Players can stake DPK tokens for rewards, while KIT tokens may be burned for staking.<br> <br> Dontplaywithkitty also offers two gaming options – a player versus environment (PvE) option where a user competes against computer-generated characters. Alternatively, players also have a PVP (player versus player) feature, where the competition is against other players on the platform.<br> <br> When fully set up, DPK will have various games. At the moment, though, only one Pet Garden is up and running. The second game, Brave World, will be launched in January 2022; the third game is currently under development and is expected to be released in Q2 in 2022.<br> <br> Among the platform’s key investors are The9 Limited and Fire Rock Holdings Limited. Other backers include Vietnam’s Roseon Finance, Korea’s SAMSUNG GAMES EVERY GAME, China’s GMC, HOT LABS and 7 O’Clock Labs.
