DeHero is a decentralized GameFi application based on BSC. By staking NFT assets, users can unbox NFT card packs blind boxes, collect NFT roles, and do card mining with appropriate training strategies. As a result, users obtain DeHero's governance token HEROES. Users can trade NFT cards in the trading market. More application scenarios, such as NFT card battles and DAO community co-governance, will be opened soon.
