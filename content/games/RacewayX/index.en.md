RacewayX is the first multi-chain text-based strategy racing game with blockchain-powered economy and prize pool redistribution contracts. Players can earn either by playing the game or owning parts of the game with ownable parts of the game in the form of verifiable NFTs.<br> <br> The gameplay is purely based on physics and player strategy with no physical controls and to play the game, you will need to own a car NFT, selecting a racetrack and ensure you have or buy the required level of gas for the race, choose your race strategy, and view the results. Races happen in the background and are determined primarily by the racer's strategy combined with a weighted random algorithm.<br> <br> The governance token: RacewayX Token (RWX), is the in-game currency which would be used for all in-game activities to build a strong gaming economy.
