"Combat Farming" through famine, transforming wastelands into utopias. Burst evil into seeds that become vegetation.<br> <br> Cede is a Strategic Action-RPG modernized by a unique mechanic called Combat Farming. Dive into the shattered pieces of your planet with 3 additional friends online, burst swarms of foes into seeds, and transform them into vegetation known as “changers”. Synchronize with your squad building the best loadouts for optimal changer benefits! Cede will initially release on PC with an online 4 player co-operative campaign and will later release on consoles along with a PVP mode for all our competitive players out there!
