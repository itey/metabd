Building on the Avalanche Blockchain, Imperium Empires is the worldâ€™s first GameFi 2.0 AAA space metaverse that (i) has deflationary tokenomics via NFT burns in PvP battles and (ii) gamifies DeFi and making DeFi accessible to 3 billion gamers over the world.<br> <br> The Imperium metaverse is a 3rd person RTS game that features a wide variety of PvE and PvP gameplay, where players team-to-earn by joining a guild of friends to conquer the metaverse and build their empires. <br> <br> We believe blockchain games and metaverses are only in year 0, but only those who know how to scale and reach 3 billion plus gamers worldwide will thrive. We identified 4 major problems commonly seen in most blockchain games that Imperium Empires will address:<br> 1. Low-quality graphics and limited gameplay;<br> 2. Hyperinflationary and unsustainable tokenomics;<br> 3. Lack of deep DeFi integration;<br> 4. Lack of guild-based gameplay.<br> <br> Imperium Empires addresses each of the 4 problems by<br> 1. Building a AAA-quality metaverse with an experienced inhouse game development and game design team;<br> 2. Embedding a unique NFT burn mechanism where NFTs (e.g. spaceships) can be damaged or destroyed in PvP zones that players voluntarily enter;<br> 3. Gamifying DeFi and seamlessly connecting 3 billion+ gamers worldwide to DeFi through integrating top DeFi protocols on the Avalanche ecosystem into the Imperium metaverse;<br> 4. Pioneering team-to-earn where guilds are closely tied with our gameplay. Along with our official guild and scholar manage.
