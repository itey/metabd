Fairy Forest is an NFT game based on a web browser that strives to be recognized as the best of gaming crypto projects. In this world, you can sow, grow your own plants and fight with other Players.<br> Each plant is a unique NFT creature that can possess artifacts for improvements: elixir, crystal, magic stone and root. Combine them together to create new rare and exciting combinations of benefits. Plants with a higher level can defeat stronger enemies and get better rewards. Everyone has the same opportunity to get plants. Any plant can grow from seven, from the most common to the rarest. <br> Artifacts are rare magical elements that give more advantages to the plant for a while: protection, health, reward and attack.<br> Rental: each player has the possibility to have on his farm. In it, you can have 4 basic plants plus 1 mother tree. These plants can also be used in all future game modes. The main game tab will allow you to buy seeds/plants in the Market, tools, skins and various other things. In addition, we will use an oracle and stable coin system to limit earnings based on the amount of money our players spend in the game
