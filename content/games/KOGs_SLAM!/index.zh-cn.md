KOGs are collectible &amp; playable non-fungible tokens (NFTs)<br> <br> What’s an NFT? Non-fungible tokens are digital assets registered on an unchangeable blockchain. Best of all, no two NFTs are exactly alike. And once we mint a series of KOGs, that’s it. After minting, there’s no changing the content or mintage figures for that series’ NFTs!<br> <br> KOGs-powered games are breaking the boundaries of blockchain’s capabilities. While most collectible NFTs are just nice to look at, KOGs are always ready to play. You can collect, trade, and sell KOGs — or pit them against other gamers in online tournaments.<br> <br> Not only can you use these digital collectibles as playable game pieces, but KOGs are usable within the entire RFOX ecosystem to unlock special features and functions.
