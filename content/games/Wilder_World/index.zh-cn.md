Wilder World is a New Dimension of Reality and Immersive 5D Metaverse built on Ethereum, Unreal Engine 5 and ZERO. Wilder World is powered by the WILD token which is used on the Wilder World Metaverse Market where you can buy and trade NFTs with in-world utility. The Wilder vision is to create a community-owned, fully decentralized Nation to be experienced in our immersive photorealistic 5D Metaverse.<br> <br> The first city in Wilder World is called Wiami which is set on an alternative timeline in a nearby dimension. Wiami is a Protopia that has a futuristic vibe playing off of 80s Miami, with a CyberPunk flair and a touch of fantasy. Player vs Player (PvP) and Play to Earn (P2E) is a key part of Wiami, which can be engaged through various micro games. The first micro game will be racing for pink slips using our Wilder Wheels NFTs... Think GTA with real stakes on the line! Beyond that, Wiami will provide an expansive virtual environment for both Artists and Collectors to explore. Wiami is currently in development with a team of over 80 people contributing from 20+ different countries around the world.<br> <br> When can I start playing in the Wilder World Metaverse? <br> The Wilder World immersive experience has yet to launch, but a version of the Wiami Alpha is intended to be rolled out to a small group of folks in December 2021.
