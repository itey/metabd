Mint your Solajumper NFT for 1.2 SOL, and get 10 lives in the Genesis tournament.<br> After the tournament, you can choose to trade your NFT on the secondary market or to keep it and participate in the monthly tournament.<br> Our vision aims at merging the video game world with top-of-the-line tools to enable the widespread use of NFT technology in our day-to-day lives. We view NFTs and Blockchain technology as groundbreaking and work consistently on its implementations in the Gaming industry.<br> We are working on developing multi-chain and cross-platform reusable NFT As Service (NAS) and expanding constantly the capabilities of such services.
