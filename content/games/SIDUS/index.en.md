.A World Populated by 12 Races with Endless Missions and Adventures<br> SIDUS transports players to a whole new world in which technological advancements have reached a level where they have merged with all living beings, becoming as one with them. The universe is inhabited by 12 tech-based races that represent different blockchains and are already familiar to the community — Bitcoione, Etheredus, Avalanya, Polkacyon and others. Just like in the NFT collection, character, features and a Hero’s outlook on life is predetermined by the race he belongs to.<br> <br> Despite all the differences, endless clashes and chaos, SIDUS’ scenarios and missions pull in players from different backgrounds and push them to find common ground. If they want to advance, they must collaborate. United, players can join forces and go on difficult missions together.<br> <br> In the futuristic game, players can choose any role for themselves:<br> Some will go with violence and strive for power. Heroes can challenge other players to duels in the Battle Arena or build fighting legions and try to rise to the top as one.<br> Wanderlust souls will be able to spend their time exploring all corners of the metaverse and seek out many adventures while doing so. Heroes can equip their spaceship for long travels and plow the galaxy as pirates plunder the seas.<br> Heroes with a creative flow can become builders and farmers, generally working to transform their own little corner of the universe into an oasis amid the world of chaos.<br> Born leaders can participate in the political life of SIDUS. They can take part in the political race, representing their people and lobbying for their interests.
