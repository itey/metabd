A long long time ago, the Pandas were totally BAMBOOzled by the Old Gods. Their home planet was destroyed, their most scarce resources - Bambooniums - were robbed from them.<br> <br> To rebuild the home planet, the Panda Elders entrusted the most elite Panda warriors with the mandate of retrieving all Bambooniums. The Paladin Pandas travel the space scavenging, mining, and raid boss farming, all for that sweet green stuffâ€¦<br> <br> Now, Paladin Pandas assemble! FIGHT! FOR GLORY!<br> <br> PALADIN PANDAS: SPACE EXPEDITION<br> Space Expedition is a rogue-like game, a subgenre of role-playing games. Every adventure will go on a random map to fight evil invaders.<br> <br> Every time you defeat the enemies, remember to pick up the trophies! Once you beat a level, you can get a lottery ticket to win the most popular NFTs!<br> <br> Paladin Pandas have 6 classes to choose from: Main Tank, Commando, Sniper, Engineer, Medic, and CyberBard. Each class has different skills and traits.
