Influence is a space strategy MMO, set in an asteroid belt in the Adalia system, where a generational ship, the Arvad, ended up after an ill-fated journey from Earth. As a blockchain-based game, Influenceâ€™s goal is to empower the players to truly own the game universe. All in-game assets will be modeled on-chain as either NFTs, or fungible tokens (i.e. ERC-20) to ensure the player has un-censorable ownership. In the Arrival release, the 250,000 asteroids in the Adalia system will be sold off as ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
