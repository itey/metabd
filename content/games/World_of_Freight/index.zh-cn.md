Race your trucks, boats, trains, and spaceships against other NFT holders! The NFTs passively generate the in-game utility token which can be used to upgrade the appearance of the vehicle and stats. Freight Punk (driver) NFT integration coming soon!<br> <br> At the World of Freight NFT ecosystem, everything revolves around the collection of 10,000 unique vehicle-themed NFTs.<br> <br> These vehicles double as your membership card that grants access to a variety of exclusive benefits. You will earn WOF utility tokens, play a P2E racing game, mint new NFT collections for free, and get access to THE BOARDROOM — the collaborative space dedicated to building the Supplain protocol.
