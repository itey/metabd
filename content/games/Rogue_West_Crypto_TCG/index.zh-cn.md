Travel across the alternative America of the Wild West era, where danger awaits around every corner: zombies, fanatics and outlaws of all kinds. Build a unique deck and compete with other players! <br> <br> Unlike other digital TCGs, our cards are NFTs and issued in strictly limited quantities, so they have a real collector's value.<br> <br> Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are the new Wild West. Just like Rogue West: Crypto TCG!
