ZED is a digital horse racing game where players can build a stable of racehorses by buying, breeding, and racing digital racehorses. The ultimate goal in ZED is to create a legacy with a valuable stable full of winning and rare racehorses. The more you breed and race, the greater your legacy becomes. Once your stable is formed with at least one racehorse, you can earn a profit if you decide to sell, breed or race!
