Binemon is a virtual pet non-fungible token (NFT) game on Binance Smart Chain, combining elements of an idle RPG game. Players can collect and trade eggs, ambrosia (fusion), characters, items and land. In addition, players are connected to fight in player-versus-environment (PvE) and player-versus-player (PvP) modes and receive cryptocurrency rewards. Designed in a comic-like style reminiscent of Pokemon, the game is set on Planet Earth with creatures called “Mons”, created by extraterrestrial creatures and now live on four different continents. These Mons are NFTs that players can collect and use to battle other players and their Mons. Players can also explore the infinite open-world landscape and collect Ambrosia (AMB), the in-game commodity that upgrades and empowers their mons.
