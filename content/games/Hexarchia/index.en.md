Hexarchia is a war&amp;strategy videogame inspired by chess and the most important civilizations in history. Warlords and emperors collide in gripping battles all against each others for the rule of Elysium, the mythical world in which the game is set. Hexarchia is a desktop and mobile game developed with Unreal Engine, the most advanced game engine in existence. Two modes will be available: free-to-play and play-to-win. The first is dedicated to those who simply want to have fun, while the second to those who want to earn cryptocurrencies. Users will earn non-fungible tokens playing both modes. Thanks to Ethereum and major Layer 2 solutions we guarantee players the ownership of the characters and items that can be used in-game or freely exchanged and sold on the marketplace on our website or on third-party marketplaces.
