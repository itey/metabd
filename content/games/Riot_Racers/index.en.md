Riot Racers is a play-to-earn car racing game, where participants own parts of the game. Players can actively earn by racing cars, or they can passively earn by owning various assets in the game. All purchasable parts of the game are in the form of verifiably owned NFTs.<br> <br> The currency in Riot Racers is the RIOT token, a fungible ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Players use RIOT tokens to enter races, upgrade vehicles, earn in-game rewards, and more.
