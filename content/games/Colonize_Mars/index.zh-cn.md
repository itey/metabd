Own a part of the first-ever Mars Colony on the blockchain.<br> <br> Players can participate by making an identity on mars.cards, staking one or more of their Cards to colony items, and earning Martia Token through colony maintenance. All Cards involved in the Colonize Mars game are NFTs.<br> <br> Players can select expedition-ready items from the colony, choose a plot of land from the Martian landscape, and mine it for Ore if the land’s health rating is high or restore the land if it’s health rating is low. Each mission also has a small chance at making a scientific discovery.
