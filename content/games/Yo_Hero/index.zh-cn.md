YOLO are NFT pets in the YoHero metaverse. Each YOLO is unique and has great collection value, and has the ability to fight and summon. YoHero delegates all the rights of YOLO's summoning to the community. The team is only responsible for auctioning the original creation YOLO., and subsequent YOLOs are all summoned by players.<br> <br> The YoHero team initially launched eight YOLOs, corresponding to eight occupations, namely; Taoist Priest, Shaman, Mage, Warrior, Sacrifice, Warlock, Knight, and Assasin.<br> <br> Players who enter the YoHero metaverse need to purchase 5 YOLO initially, and obtain continously valued YO tokens and YHC tokens through battles and summons.
