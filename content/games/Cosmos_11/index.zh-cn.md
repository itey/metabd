Who are we?<br> We are the first-ever NFT Play to Earn Football Manager Game.<br> <br> What is a Football Manager Game?<br> A football team consists of 11 players, a coach, medics, and tactics. Our users have full control over their personal setup and can change around everything to their liking.<br> <br> How do I get players, medics, coaches, and tactics?<br> You will be able to purchase all of the above in our drops, or from the secondary market.<br> <br> Why would you want to play Cosmos11?<br> Cosmos11 strives to be the number one play-to-earn game in the WAX ecosystem. With our current team, we believe that we can achieve these goals through our futuristic gameplay, and levels of staking yields for every player, coach, and medic depending on their level and rarity.<br> In addition, we are building a community of like-minded people around our metaverse. <br> Our mission is to grow with the ecosystem and our community to give everyone the best possible experience. <br> <br> Incentivizing Gameplay<br> ‌The common misconception with play-to-earn games is that you simply buy an NFT card that offers a staking yield and use it to cash out for a daily income. Although a daily income sounds great, it can also hurt the game tremendously or even worse, ruin the game completely.‌<br> Here at Cosmos11, we want to bring the current misconception of free money to rest and bring the play to earn back to what it is supposed to be. To counter this current trend within the community, we created our model to highly incentivize early supporters and those who actually play.
