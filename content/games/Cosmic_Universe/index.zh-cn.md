Cosmic Universe is a fantasy multi-planetary adventure MMORPG being developed on the Harmony blockchain. It is play-and-earn and integrates exclusive character and land NFT collections, focusing heavily on buying and developing land, harvesting and mining resources, P2E and PVE sidequests, acquiring skills and magic, and forging alliances, all while developing increasingly advanced plots and settlements. Following the play-and-earn model, anyone can earn token rewards through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem.
