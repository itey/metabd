Who we are ?<br> KILLAZ is a collection of 9,971 heroes and villians who have infested Crash City. Each one has honed their killer instincts with armor, weapons, masks, accessories, and special powers. Minting a KILLA gives exclusive access to all drops in and out of Crash City. In development is a turn based RPG built around the KILLAZ characters. Every piece of the game will be tokenized and distributed to our holders so the community will own the game and share in its success.<br> <br> About the game<br> The KILLAz universe is set in Crash City, a fictional world filled with all types of KILLAz. In the game, you will battle through the city, fighting other KILLAz and monsters in an attempt to reconnect with the Overlord.<br> <br> Style<br> The game is a turn-based 2d RPG. If you've played games like Final Fantasy, you'll be familiar with the playstyle and feel. You will party up and fight your way through the city, with a band of KILLAz to control.<br> <br> The KILLAz RPG will be broken down into individual chapters to allow for community feedback and to decide the direction of the franchise.<br> <br> Tokenized Game<br> To give an ownership stake in the game, the game itself will be fractionalized, tokenized and distributed to KILLAz holders. This is a single event that will happen when the first KILLAz game is released.<br> <br> This gives KILLAZ owners additional ownership and stake in the success of all future games that are released.<br> <br> Fighting Game<br> Due to our roadmap getting blown out in 14 minutes, we will begin development on a fighting game once the RPG has been created. This will be another way to band together as a community and battle with one another to determine who is the best KILLA.
