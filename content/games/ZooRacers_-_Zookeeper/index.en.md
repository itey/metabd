ZooRacers is a multiplayer, Play-and-Earn game that will mix fun and skills in a challenging multi-chain environment.<br> <br> All ZooNFT types will be usable in-game and ZooRacers will be fully ZooGenes compatible.<br> <br> Emphasis will be on having fun, and all in-game mechanics will focus on boosting the player’s adrenaline levels. Our racing circuits will reflect our various partner’s theme elements as well as famous crypto themes such as BTC or DOGE for example.<br> <br> Of course, ZooRacers will use vZOO, the decentralized cross-chain token (more details here and explainer video here) and ZooKeeper will also sponsor all transaction fees on new wallets created for the game (exclusively for Wanchain players).<br> <br> There will also be a special market on OpenZoo, created by Yggdrazil, which will offer players a wide selection of options for further customization.<br> <br> The game will set the fundamentals of our artistic direction which is an essential first step to the creation of an extensive games library.
