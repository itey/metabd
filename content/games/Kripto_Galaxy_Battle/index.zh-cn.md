Kripto Galaxy Battle is a Play-to-earn project combining NFT technology and gaming experience. Not only are digital collectibles created using KardiaChain technology, but all NFT can also be integrated into gameplay later, which will help them increase the value. NFT is the heart of this project. Each character and item of Kripto Galaxy Battle is a unique, genuine asset. Players can assemble two robots or monsters to create a new one or craft their assets with incredible weapons or helpful tools to engage them in various purposes. Itâ€™s an exciting game with a universe of hidden values awaiting the users to discover.
