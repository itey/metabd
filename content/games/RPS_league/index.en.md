RPS league is a Play-to-Earn that uses the Binance Smart Chain and its rules are based on the famous and known Rock Paper Scissors. <br> <br> The millenary game that has transcended cultures and centuries now is on the Blockchain chapter.<br> <br> To play you must have a team of 3 hands (Rock Paper and Scissors). You get it by opening a box where you can get different NFTs dominated by different rarities where each type of hand belongs to a raze with different benefits like energies, amount of rewards, advantages on PVE and PVP against other teams, and more.
