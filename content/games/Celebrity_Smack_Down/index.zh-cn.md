CSD is the first video game to be built on the Nervos Network, where players use their celebrities (NFTs) in a turn-based battle system in order to cancel their opponents' roster. <br> Inspired by the MTV show “Celebrity Deathmatch”, CSD is here to parody the absurdities of fame and the current climate of cancel culture.<br> <br> What makes CSD NFTs special is that the cards are connected to a specific and unique tweet of the corresponding celebrity and with its twitter feed. CSD NFTs change power levels based on the number of followers the celebrities gain which impacts their effectiveness in game.<br> <br> -Scholarship system<br> -Card rarity<br> -Lands system<br> -Powerups<br> -Ranking system<br> <br> Our intention is to combine the P2E world with the cards collectors world. Imagine your favourite celebrity tweet minted in a trading card, wouldn't that be neat?
