Zeal is an indie Action RPG that allows you to build your character and fight against players in Arenas, slay creatures in Dungeons and conquer savage lands against both in Conquest Mode.<br> <br> Forgoing traditional MMORPG aspects, in the world of Zeal you login and pick your character. Once you've done that, you jump right into the action! Be it solo mode or with friends, Zeal is MMORPG combat with none of the MMORPG grind. <br> <br> Zeal is a PvP-focused game but will also include PvE modes of play. Dungeons that will challenge your skills along with both single player and co-op campaigns await for all those who can stand to stop fighting each other long enough!
