Domi Online invites you to embark on an ever lasting journey in an expansive medieval world. Explore a vast variety of forests, deserts, ruins, caves and islands, and fight the mythical beasts that roam the land, in search for treasure and unparalleled power.<br> The common MMORPG model of this era requires players to do tedious quests in order to reach the same maximum level quickly, and sign up for repetitive dungeon farming to get the best gear. The result is: Most people on the server are much all the same at the end of the season, and when an expansion is introduced, your time is rendered worthless, as all your gear is the same as what new players start with, and the level can be grinded out in no time.<br> <br> In Domi Online there is no level cap, no skill cap, and PvP and death has major consequences. Domi pays homage to the older RPGs that are still being played today 20 years later, by implementing improved old school skill and level mechanics, but without the old school combat system or graphics. Creating an opportunity for serious gamers to dominate and be respected, loved or feared for their commitment to time spent is valuable, with an ecosystem that rewards the hours the player puts in, both in power and in economical value.
