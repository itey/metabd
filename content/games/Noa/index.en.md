Build a deck of 16 hero cards and 10 support cards. When the game starts, 4 random hero cards are placed on the battlefield along with 2 random support cards. Your heroes will battle the enemy cards and every time a hero goes to 0HP, a new one emerges from the draw pile until all 16 are destroyed. The player that still has at least 1 hero card on the battlefield wins. You will receive NOA token as reward and if you are lucky, you will get some rare loot such as shards to upgrade your cards, in-game exclusive heroes, charms, boosters and more, a lot more!
