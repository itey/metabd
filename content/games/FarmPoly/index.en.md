FarmPoly is a happy harvest-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through gameplay and ecosystem contributions. Players can plant, collect, create and build a farm to raise their animals and crops, as a lot of possibilities in an open world, with houses in the city center, gold mining or Bitcoin.<br> In addition to Farmpoly being a fun game, it also takes on the characteristics of a social network and job platform due to the strong community and "play to earn".<br> <br> Initially you can buy one item or three items making up the full farm, however, the more items, the higher your income in the game.
