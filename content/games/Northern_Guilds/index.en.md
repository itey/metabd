Northern Guilds is, at its core, an MMO. Players will find themselves exploring the vast and unforgiving lands of Midgard, Asgard and JÃ¶ttunheim. Each player will have to tackle quests, pillage ruins, and outsmart enemies to come out on top in an unwinnable war.<br> <br> Dungeons, caves, and boss arenas will give players an opportunity to team up and fight against huge monsters for rare loot. These raids are planned by players and can be executed by players in raiding parties, or as few as one brave - and very foolish - warrior. <br> <br> We intend to provide all our players with a unique experience as they travel through Midgard. This world has existed long before you, and its flora, fauna and ecosystems reflect it. In the grand scheme of things, you are but a blip on the timeline of this world.<br> <br> Midgard is a huge place with lots of potential for players to settle their camps and slowly transform them into villages with their own traders, inns, and taverns. These settlements are expensive to make, and require a great deal of time, energy, and luck to build and successfully operate. This allows late game players the opportunity to show off their might and create their own empire. <br> <br> Our goal is to provide our players with limitless opportunities to fuel their fun and advance their story. When alone, players can fish, hunt, and gather resources to financially support themselves. Battle-hardened players can also fight in underground rings or bet on fights as alternative ways to pad their pockets. <br> <br> With Northern Guilds, we want to tell a story, and give players the opportunity to write their own legacy in whatever beautiful, creative, and inventive way they choose. No matter if you go it alone or tackle it with friends, the story of Northern Guilds is your story, Midgard is your world, and your adventure will go down in history for millennia to come.
