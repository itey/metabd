BFK Warzone is a specialized gaming ecosystem on the Binance Smart Chain which will be completely powered by our native token $BFK. Certik audited.<br> <br> We are currently in development of our 2D with 3D isometric views NFT Play-To-Earn shooter game and NFT Marketplace. We are a strictly gaming focused project with simple 5% taxes for buying/selling as well as 0% tax on wallet to wallet transactions.<br> <br> The Interactive NFT Marketplace will feature in-game characters called Fortis which can be used to earn tokens in multiple game modes. Users can start playing right away with a free Legacy character called C. Draxis, a battle warrior from the army unit. This character comes equipped with 2 weapons, the M4 Carbine and the M4A16. Other characters can be purchased on the marketplace or can be minted using our unique minting algorithm which retains rarity based on total users.<br> <br> Soldiers range from Navy Seals, Paratroopers, Snipers, Medics, Machine Gunners and Special Forces. You can challenge your gaming buddies in several different modes including 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 5v5. Fortis can join forces by reserving their slot, and take down the enemy bosses in dungeon style gameplay where $BFK tokens and loot are dropped and rewarded based on contributions to the fight.
