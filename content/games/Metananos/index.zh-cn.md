Our vision is to create a next level, high quality 3D play-to-earn metaverse where users can buy, train and trade their NANOs and let them compete against each other in a universe of different games. <br> <br> Each game can interpret the NANOs and its power gems in its own specific way and thus differently. Games can require additional equipment which NANOs need to use in order to join the game. <br> <br> Each NANO has its own stats and a power gem that can be used to win within the game.
