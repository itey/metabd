Chibi Fighters are cute little warriors that know no mercy. Don't be fooled by their appearance, they are fiercy fighters. The really hardcore will enter the Ring of Death. Only one Chibi will survive it. But you can win real Ether in return.<br> <br> It's a fun brawler aiming at casual gamers. There is no levelling or stressful gameplay.<br> <br> However Chibis will have lots of surprises up their sleeves after launch.
