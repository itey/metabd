As legend goes, a mysterious genesis stumbled across a magic called “blockchain” and created an escape from the world known to mankind. Deities were also born to guard the plentiful lands of this CryptoEmpire.<br> <br> The story is just beginning, and only a chosen few - who are truly competent at blockchain - will become keepers of this new order.<br> <br> CryptoEmpire is a NFT trading card game based on real-time cryptocurrency markets. Players battle each other with four-card decks, where each NFT card is tied to its real-time token price. The strength of card combinations are calculated based on prices of the blockchain token at time of battle, and the player with a higher "attack value" wins the match.
