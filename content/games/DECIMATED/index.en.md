Backstory<br> Earth has been abandoned after hundreds of years of destructive climate change, and catastrophic neglect of the environment by corporations and industries. Political and social unrest has left the old cities decimated and hostile to life. Civilization has collapsed and destroyed itself.<br> <br> Only obedient first class citizens have been permitted onto the new world. The unworthy—criminals, dissidents, and the poor—scavenge in the forgotten cities of the old world. Earth, as we used to know it, has become overgrown with jungle, flooded by swamps, swallowed by sand, and frozen by ice. <br> <br> Pollution and technological debris litter the environment, and survivors have set up shelter in destroyed skyscrapers, laboratories, abandoned metros and crumbling freeways.<br> <br> In this sci-fi dystopian future, only the fittest can survive. <br> <br> The world is inhabited by other friendly/hostile players, plus NPC’s including malfunctioning robots, bio-monsters and mutated creatures; all competing for survival, resources and territory.<br> <br> Players can choose to be a Human Citizen or a Cyborg Cop.<br> <br> Which side will you choose?
