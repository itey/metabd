An open world Play2Earn MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) built on the blockchain. We want to bring excitement, enjoyment and entertainment to the world of NFT gaming! This will be achieved through the incorporation of all the core elements of popular MMORPGs, e.g. PvE, PvP, diverse classes and skills, quests, party and guilds, dungeons, cosmetic customisation, pets, and many more. <br> <br> Ukiyo will feature beautiful anime style art to allow for a beautiful online gaming experience, as there is nothing quite like stepping into the realm of a visually stunning virtual environment.
