What truly differentiates a king from a Lord is how well they grow their empire. While the ultimate goal is to go light-fold into a peaceful inter galactic META future, the journey is not going to be that easy. Scale your kingdom, build powerful armies, train your spies, educate your masses, start a religion, adopt social policies, use diplomacy to maintain good relations with your neighbors or maybe crush them and acquire their land. While leading an empire is fun in itself, we intend to reward our META rulers with $CITY tokens for every task done based on “proof of effort” and community voting.
