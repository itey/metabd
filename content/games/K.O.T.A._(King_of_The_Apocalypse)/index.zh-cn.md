KOTA is a FPS strategy survival game that utilizes the ZENZO Blockchain for true digital asset ownership. This means that a player can possess full access at all times their KOTA in-game items (each backed by a ZNZ value). Furthermore, players can then do whatever they wish, whether that is trade, sell, smelt (destroy and receive ZNZ), or keep.
