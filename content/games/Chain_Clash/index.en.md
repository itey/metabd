Chain Clash is a free-to-play collectible and battle game. Players can collect and train a variety of avatar fighters and join forces with like-minded people to form crypto clans. Ultimately, you will engage in competitive battles with your rivals, prevail, and hopefully prove the power of your clan!<br> <br> You will have complete ownership of an avatar as with any NFT. You can hold it and increase its monetary and competitive value as it levels up. Later on, you can sell it for EOS or even use it in other upcoming games from the Chain Clash franchise.
