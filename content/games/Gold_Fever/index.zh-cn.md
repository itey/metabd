Gold Fever is a challenging free-to-play survival RPG hybrid that leverages the power of the blockchain to create a decentralised economy around its limited resources and various NFT items.<br> <br> Face the horrors of the dark and haunting jungle as you engage in fast-paced battles against the opposing faction. Complex terrain and widely varying character strengths &amp; weaknesses make for intense and highly strategic fights.<br> <br> Through the power of NFTs, own the items you create, find or purchase. Involve in developing the infrastructure required for players to navigate and play in our huge world or acquire expensive planes or gold tools and rent them to other players.<br> <br> Use our governance token to vote and dictate the future of the game.
