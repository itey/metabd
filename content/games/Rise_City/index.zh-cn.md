RiseCity is a passive game in which you will not have to do anything other than claim once you have the buildings. <br> At first your priority will be to build them, for this you will need materials that will appear on the map every day. <br> A total of 18 materials you can purchase per day, 6 of each: wood, iron and stone. When you have the houses ready you can inhabit them with villagers to increase their productivity. <br> The reward will be associated with an oracle tool from the first moment. This means that the earnings will be fixed in dollars 💵 which will ensure a long life for RiseCity.
