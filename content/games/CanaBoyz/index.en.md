The first blockchain game about growing cannabis<br> Each user is protected from a sharp collapse course and is guaranteed to make a profit!<br> <br> It all starts with the CNB token, having this token opens the first stage in the<br> world of Canaboyz for you, which means you can generate a seed and you<br> will accidentally drop one of the many varieties. At this moment, the token<br> burning mechanic is triggered.<br> <br> Having generated a seed, the player faces the first choice: sell it in one of the coffee shops or plant<br> it in a pot and wait for the harvest. Suppose we chose the second option and now the player's task<br> is to water his bush every day and wait until it sprouts and gives the first crop.
