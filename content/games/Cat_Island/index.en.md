Cat Island is a browser play-to-earn game set in a relaxing island full of Cats. In this world, Cats are hard workers and great adventurers, fishing along the sea, exploring wild islands and building their own society.<br> <br> Players can sell and earn NFT assets stored on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20). They will be able to earn rewards from different sources; these rewards will be in the form of tokens that can be either exchanged in cryptocurrency markets, used in our marketplace, or within the game. <br> Cats are able to fish, explore, farm and craft, while building their own piece of land. Players manage their Cats, taking care and upgrading them, earning rewards through different activities and events.
