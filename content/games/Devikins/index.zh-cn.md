Developed by MoonLabs - a brand new game studio composed of industry veterans - Devikins has an ever-expanding world with a player first mentality. Each playable character in Devikins is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), which means that each player is the sole owner of a wholly unique playable character in both the Devikins universe and real world. In addition, players can keep their collection of characters fresh and aim for the strongest, most competitive character possible via the breeding system. <br> <br> DVK can be purchased in Klever Wallet / Klever Exchange
