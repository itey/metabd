Cradles: Origin of Species is a next-gen blockchain MMORPG which you can play on your PC or mobile. <br> <br> Players can explore the Cradles open-world, which is set in a prehistoric time not unlike the Triassic age. <br> <br> As players build towns and learn new technologies, and achieve higher levels of governance, the in-game civilization develops and advances the world through era progression, such as from the Triassic age to the Jurassic age.<br> <br> Uniquely, entropy in the Cradles metaverse increases with time — just as the real world does.<br> <br> Cradles engineers have developed a brand-new ERC protocol for the game, called the ERC-3664, which will attach a time attribute to all of the props. <br> <br> The game will let you use your VR device for an immersive experience, choosing from a wide range of species to play as.
