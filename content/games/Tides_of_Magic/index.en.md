Welcome to the Tides of Magic, we are a brand new trading card game on the ethereum blockchain. We are unique in that erc721 tokens from other games can be pulled into this one and interacted with. This is a challenging hurdle but we are passionate that these types of games move blockchain in the right direction. Not only should game assets be on-chain, but they all should be able to interact with each other, regardless of the project. Join us as we make advances in blockchain and have fun while we do it.
