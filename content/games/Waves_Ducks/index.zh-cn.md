Waves Ducks is a collectible play-to-earn NFT game. During the game, the players use different game mechanics to earn in-game currency (eggs, or EGG tokens), used to buy NFT ducks — the main characters of the game. More ducks give more EGG income to buy even more ducks. This is how a player develops its duck farm.
