Funky Fruits are a series of 10,000 randomly generated characters created by an eccentric scientist with quite the green thumb.<br> <br> The Funky Fruit Multiverse will entail a series of games and challenges that will allow our holders to compete with another or work together for prizes. Rather than a test of who has the most money, our games will test the skill and knowledge of our holders. Our first game will be called Funky Facts, a trivia game that tests the knowledge of our holders.<br> <br> Once launched, Funky Facts trivia games will occur on a regular interval. We will have a web portal on which a holder can connect their wallet and join the game with their NFT. From there, the Mad Scientist will ask a series of questions. In order to stay in the game, youâ€™ll have to choose the right answer the question. The last fruits standing will receive rewards in SOL (and sometimes other cool rewards).
