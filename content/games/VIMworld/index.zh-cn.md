VIMworld is a next generation, blockchain-powered smart collectible (Smart NFT) platform and ecosystem. In VIMworld, users collect and interact with smart collectibles called VIMs, going through various interactive and rewarding experiences with them across worlds. The EHrT token is the cryptocurrency that powers the platform.<br> <br> As of now, users can collect VIMs and apply them across a variety of experiences, including, feeding, trading, gaming, earning rewards and more. More features are being released periodically on a consistent basis, such as battling, dungeon crawls and other types of unique and fun interactions.<br> <br> Besides collecting VIMs, they can be used in games built to take advantage of the smart collectibles. These games and experiences will be introduced at a later date.
