Nifty Island is an open social gaming platform and virtual world being developed by Nyft Studios. It will be the centerpiece and first title in what we call the Nyftverse: a set of interoperable games, a marketplace, play-to-earn protocol, game developer tools and infrastructure â€”all powered by web3 to realize the dream of a truly open and player-owned metaverse.
