RHINOS FLYLAND is a blockchain game that allows players to earn income by breeding, training, battling, and trading digital pets, called RINOs. The more powerful RINOs you own, the more money you will make by selling them on the Marketplace. Players are able to earn RHO tokens, similar to SLP tokens in the game Axie Infinity. <br> <br> Our mission is to make blockchain games more immersive and create legitimacy and permanent value. In addition, we will donate 50% of the profits to support global NGOs that protect wildlife around the world.
