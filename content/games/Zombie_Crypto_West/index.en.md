About<br> Zombie Crypto West is a unique wild west zombie infested world for you to shoot your way through. It combines shooter, survival and rpg elements, connected with blockchain technology. Crazy action but very simple controls will help to take on the hordes and become the best zombie survival expert!<br> <br> Core gameplay<br> You'll start you jorney from the safe saloon, where you can upgrade your character and gear. Next, you'll go to wild west wastelands, full of zombies. Killing zombies on your way to progress, collect dropped coins. When you run out of ammo, run back to safe bar. If you will die during your trip, you will return to the bar, loosing one life though. To play again you will need to take a rest (wait cooldown) or you can purchase one more life with ZCW tokens. Collected coins you will be able to spend on buying ammo and upgrades.<br> <br> Heroes<br> You will start as a Ranger hero. You will be able to progress with him, levelup and upgrade for ingame coins. Also you will be able to play as different, unique NFT heroes, that are much stronger and have unique abilities. You will be able to mint your hero, with your unique name and stats. The minting price of the hero NFT will increase linearly for every next minting. Part of the minting price will go to the rewards pool, part will go to the weekly rewards pool, part to liquidity pool and part will go to the buyback and burning pool. For leveling up of NFT hero you will need to pay a comission. While minting a hero, or leveling up a hero, you'll have a chance to mint or convert your hero to the legengary hero! Higher hero level will increase your chances to drop ZCW tokens in the zombie boss mine. Keep in mind that you can enter the zombie boss mine only with the NFT hero.
