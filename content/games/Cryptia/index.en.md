WORLD OF CRYPTIA is a full-scale RPG fantasy game where players take the role of intrepid adventurers who travel from one enigmatic ancient ruin to another in groups, overcoming grueling, multi-level obstacles, all in the hope to be prized with the rarest enchanted antiquities from the long lost civilization of sorcerous elites. By buying and sharing treasures, weapons, and heroes at the in-game marketplace using our special tokens, players earn the freedom to build an inseparable community whose voices determine the future of the game as a whole, whose hands take ownership of irreplaceable NFTs, and whose account cash out a copious amount of real money to spend freely in the real world.
