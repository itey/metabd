Wanaka Farm setting is inspired by a dreamy beautiful town from the South<br> Island of New Zealand called Wanaka. The game feel will incorporate as much sight and<br> sound of Wanaka to evoke natural beauty and immersive relaxing experience as<br> possible.<br> At Wanaka Farm, players will immerse themselves in the role of a happy farmer<br> by cultivating lands, crop farming, breeding pets, and decorating their own virtual<br> land. From then, each participant will contribute to building a whole metaverse<br> combining multiple unique customized farms.
