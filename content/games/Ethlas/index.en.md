Ethlas is a Free-To-Play (F2P), Play-To-Earn (P2E) metaverse built on the Polygon chain where players engage with a suite of skill-based games to farm gems - the main currency of Ethlas. <br> <br> Ethlas makes it possible for just about anyone to collect rewards that include in-game drops, NFTs, crypto tokens and more. <br> <br> Best of all, itâ€™s designed to be F2P so that it forms an onramp for the next billion fiat users to get to know crypto better. And of course not forgetting our crypto natives - we have in game mechanics designed to reward and incentive crypto natives to participate in our ecosystem!
