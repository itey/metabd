Bezogis may look cute on the outside, but behind those cute puppy eyes are fearsome warriors that pillage the lands of Bezogia to find blocks to mint mythical weapons and summon more Bezogi.<br> <br> Build your collection of Bezogi, mint legendary mythical weapons and pillage resources all using cutting edge Blockchain technology.<br> <br> ITEM MINTING<br> The mythical weapons and items in the lands of Bezogia are minted directly from the blocks. Use your blocks to mint legendary weapons and items such as the Green Candle, a rock-solid sword strong enough to crack a skull or ten, often used to light the way while hunting down foes in dark caves.<br> <br> Or perhaps the legendary Gas Mask created by the purebred Freezogi, a crudely engineered bio-enhancing Gas Mask, which melds with their face, attaching horrifically to the teeth, which, when activated, supplies a constant stream of intoxicating gas. The dreaded mask, which when seen in the dark sends shivers down the spines of everything in view, gives Bezogi a sudden pump in strength and stamina.<br> <br> Collect magical blocks in the lands of Bezogia and mint your own collection of mythical NFT items.<br> <br> SUMMONING<br> Mix and match Bezogi to summon powerful and unique Bezogi. Hoard your Bezogi like the famous Fud King of Bezogia, or start your own summoning business and sell your summoned Bezogi at Bull Market.<br> <br> Each Bezogi has it’s own unique attributes based on the coloring of it’s body parts, each representing a different percentage of skill boost. The breed and DNA of Bezogis is directly derived from the two Bezogi used to summon, the purer the blood of the summoners, the higher the chance of getting a rare, epic or even purebred Bezogi.
