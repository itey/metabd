Our game is built simple enough so that anyone with the minimum knowledge of blockchain can play, but still comprehensive enough for in-depth players to explore and earn more through a deep understanding of the system. Furthermore, with a well-designed tokenomy, Dogeon helps players to achieve incentives at a sustainable rate. In general, our purpose is to give players great and precious experiences while still maintaining certain earnings for players.
