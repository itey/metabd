Welcome To The Worldwide Webb<br> An interoperable, dystopian pixel art metaverse giving utility to popular NFT projects.<br> <br> The Worldwide Webb is an MMORPG metaverse game that uses NFTs for in-game avatars, pets, lands, items, and quests. Deployed with a build-first mentality by a group of crypto-native game developers, artists, coders, and marketers; rapidly pushing out new technologies and applications.<br> <br> What makes this Metaverse special?<br> Our vision is to create a template for metaverses, with community at its core. By continuing to incorporate a wide array of NFT projects into our world, we aim to provide communities with the tools to build and create their own spaces inside the Worldwide Webb.<br> <br> Our 2D ‘Ready Player One’ inspired pixel-verse functions without laborious 3D rendering, enabling unprecedentedly swift integration of NFT projects, quests, storylines, items, and smart contracts. Avatar project integration is mutually beneficial, creating valuable utility and hype for both projects. We collaborate with important collections more extensively via dedicated buildings, quests, and community events. Our current partnerships include Ponderware and Forgotten Runes Wizards Cult.
