Simps game is a risk-reward strategy game that has a relatable theme, vivid story, and a unique style of pixel art. <br> <br> The game takes place in a metaverse called the Simp City, a place where the players will witness thousands of Simps fighting for their shared dream - getting their Queens. While this seems to be a mission impossible in real life, the Simps nation gets a solid chance here. Life can be tough as they are forced by the Queens to work 24/7, but the rewards can be equally fruitful. They might win a huge bag of fortune in the lottery, discover the sacred bathwater from E-girls, or even buy a love nest exclusively for their Queens. <br> <br> Simps Game is built on Ethereum with popular Wolf Game tokenomics. It features a re-balancing between 2 characters, adding more unpredictability such as lottery and jackpots, and social features which encourage interactions between players. There are 2 types of NFTs - Simps and Queens, each with distinct attributes. In phase 1 of the game, they can stake their NFTs to earn reward tokens called $LLOVE.
