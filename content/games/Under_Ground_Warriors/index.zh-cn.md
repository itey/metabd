Underground Warriors is a play-to-earn game developed on Lamden’s blockchain.<br> In the game your character (NFT) fights in underground fights for money and fame. Your character, by winning fights, evolves and acquires better stats, as well as getting rewarded ($WP) for each glorious victory obtained.<br> Money ($WP) in the world of Underground Warriors is very valuable, so it is necessary to use it wisely.<br> You can use $WP to increase your base stats to become a better fighter, you can buy items (crystals) to evolve and learn new combat techniques. You can also buy a pet that will help you resist against more skilled opponents, or simply help your family in times of crisis (Raindrop’s mother).
