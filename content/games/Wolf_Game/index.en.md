On a quaint farm in the metaverse, a flock of Sheep congregate and produce a healthy supply of $WOOL. <br> They huddle together in a Barn and are sheared regularly by their owners to farm the $WOOL. With more $WOOL, the farmers can purchase more Sheep! But outside lurk dangers the Sheep are terrified of… The Wolves.<br> <br> The Wolves are on the hunt for Sheep and their precious $WOOL. They’ll take it by any means necessary. They’ll kidnap Sheep or catch them unaware and steal all of their $WOOL. So the farmers struck a deal with the Wolves: they pay the Wolves a tax on all $WOOL production. In return, the Wolves don’t attack Sheep who are safe in the Barn.<br> <br> But when a Sheep leaves the farm or new Sheep are born… The Wolves don’t hold back.<br> <br> Wolf Game is a risk protocol for NFTs with novel tokenomics. It shows what’s possible with interactions between the ERC-20 and ERC-721 protocols.<br> <br> For the very first time, your NFT can steal other NFTs (ERC-721 tokens) for you. The rarer your NFT, the more tokens you'll accumulate probabilistically. Wolf Game is pioneering new types of NFT mechanics. Fully decentralized. No roadmaps or empty promises. Just a game in the metaverse that’s ready to play at launch.
