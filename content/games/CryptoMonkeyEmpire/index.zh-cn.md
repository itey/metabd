CryptoMonkey Empire is a MMO-RTS (Massively<br> Multiplayer Online Real Time Strategy, like Clash of Clan, Guns of Glory...) where the main ingame resource is a cryptocurrency.<br> Currently in alpha, it will be cross-playable between desktop and compatible<br> mobile devices. <br> <br> CME is about ruling monkeys so you can build an<br> Empire. To do so, you will have to collect resources,<br> build up a city, make technological progress (require ingame mintable NFTs),<br> raise an army and attack other players to loot their<br> resources, making you even stronger.<br> One resource, the MonkeyCoin, is a cryptocurrency,<br> meaning youâ€™re going to compete and loot each<br> other an ingame resource that has a real value.<br> CME also include a Battleground, set in a large scale Third Person Shooter where you can control and fight with your troops against mighty mutants and earn rare and powerful NFTs, as well as defeated players resources. <br> Play without ads.
