The spiritual animals in the oriental culture are the inspiration for this game. This army of spiritual animals will fight against the gods that represent the worst to drive them away for a better life, luck, and happiness. The war between humankind against the ancient gods has existed since immemorial time, but their power was brutal for humans to cope with. Spiritual animals are summoned to help humans fight against those evil forces.
