Tiny Titans is intended to be a Tamagotchi-meets-Pokémon like experience for its users. The team therefore created a dApp which allows a user to hatch his/her very own and unique Tiny Titan with. Once a user minted a Titan, he can help it grow by sending it into battle against other Titans, leading it to gain experience, increase its level and boost its overall strength - all while taking care of it by feeding it once in a while. The reward for this is the unique Tiny Titans token (TITS), which can only be minted during a fight and which will serve as an ingame currency for upcoming features.<br> <br> The initial release happened with the base 300 Titans to keep an exclusive and truly unique flavor to them. As the game is 100% blockchain driven, each interaction between the user and his/her Titan is a transaction on the Binance Smart Chain and visible to everybody. <br> This makes the game unique, as most other blockchain driven projects rely on NFTs (which in most cases simply consist of a link to an off-chain stored image) stored on the blockchain, while all the game logic is executed and stored off-chain - leaving the power of will to the developers. Just imagine what happens if their server shuts down and no longer provides the artwork for their NFTs or the game logic - this can’t happen with the approach Tiny Titans chose.<br> <br> Welcome to the future of the crypto gaming industry. Welcome to decentralized gaming.
