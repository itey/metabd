My Defi Legends is an online NFT gaming platform that develops Play-to-Earn (P2E) games. MDL develops MMORPG games and a Social Media platform under its name and connects them into a blockchain. MDL created 'DLegends' token, its NFT (Non-Fungible Token), that circulates within its five or more games. The DLegends tokens are utilized to buy in-game equipment and items. Most importantly, these tokens can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies.
