Ghost Block will be a spooky and humorous play to earn game on the Binance Smart Chain.<br> <br> There will be many ways you can earn in our metaverse:<br> <br> -Staking your Ghosts to haunt The Exorcist Church to earn $HOLY.<br> -Liquidity Farming in The Research Lab to earn $ECTO.<br> -Cloning your Ghosts to earn additional Ghost NFTs.<br> -Jump into PVE and go up against the Exorcist or the Ghost Sucker in a match 3 puzzle game, that will be ported to mobile and introduce scholarships.<br> -Enjoy a trip to the Carnival of Fright to play mini-games where you can earn both tokens and other exclusive rewards.<br> <br> Players can collect multiple non-fungible tokens (NFT) such as Ghosts and Tarot Cards that they can use within the game. They can be used for haunting, researching and cloning to earn in-game token rewards.<br> <br> Ectoplasm (ECTO) is one of the two tokens used and earned in the Ghost Block game. Ectoplasm is used in Research Lab which is a variation of paired liquidity farming, and in the Cloning Chamber where players can clone their Ghosts.
