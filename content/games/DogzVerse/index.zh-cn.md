DogzVerse is developed to provide an entertaining experience to the player, where you can choose one of your pets and venture into this new world.<br> <br> Our ambition is to build a superior NFT ecosystem in the blockchain space that offers sustainable value to our users and investors, hence the game was deployed on the Binance Smart Chain and is compatible with web3 wallets such as Metamask, which will be used to accept transactions.<br> <br> DogzVerse is an 8-bit inspired game where you will have fun and adventure with your pet in this new world.<br> It all started when the other pets felt excluded from this world and decided to unite in one place, THE DOGZVERSE.
