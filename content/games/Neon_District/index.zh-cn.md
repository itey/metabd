Neon District is the cyberpunk role-playing adventure and flagship game developed by Blockade Games. Leveraging the latest in decentralized technologies, players battle to progress through a sci-fi dystopia and earn in-game NFT (non-fungible token) items.<br> <br> As you explore the streetscapes of Neon District, you’ll collect an arsenal of items and abilities to select for each encounter. Each piece of gear is a unique NFT (non-fungible token) backed by blockchain technology, meaning that it is uniquely yours and only you own that exact digital asset. As you progress through the story and collect more gear, you’ll be able to buy, sell, and trade your rewards with the international ND community.
