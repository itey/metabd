TCG World is the largest open world blockchain based game where players can earn TCGCoin 2.0, gather NFT collectibles, own virtual real estate, create, explore the game world, control their own online businesses, or just have fun. TCG World introduces a new approach to NFTs, making it more than just a piece of art - now players can take their NFTs into the virtual game world and play. Everything a player owns in the metaverse is an NFT - real estate, vehicles, pets, trophies, and even player avatars. As part of the entertainment, TCG World will also host live collectible card game tournaments at the TCG World Stadium.<br> <br> While exploring TCG World, a player will find a lot of different kinds of creatures powered by artificial intelligence algorithms. One of the characteristics of these creatures is called evolution level. Creatures found in the wild as a common rule have the first level. Creatures are tameable and once caught can be relocated to a playerâ€™s plot land.<br> <br> Players will be able to evolve, train and trade creatures. Players will also be able to fight with their creatures against other players in various small arenas spread out across the map, and at the main TCG Arena.<br> <br> TCG Worlds native currency is TCGCoin 2.0. TCGCoin 2.0 offers cross-chain transfer, which enables users to move the value of tokens between smart contracts on different blockchains, by a simple in-built TCG finance ecosystem cross-chain exchange, through the main wallets of the TCG project on different chains, at a rate of 1 token on one blockchain into 1 token on another blockchain. <br> <br> TCG World will be a living and breathing virtual world filled with real people and activities bringing the real world and the virtual metaverse world together, using the play-to-earn approach system. TCG World has its own story which will progress as a player spends more time in the game.
