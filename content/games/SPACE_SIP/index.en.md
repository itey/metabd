Space SIP is a blockchain-based game that revolves around collecting, upgrading and crafting powerful spaceships. The player can also fight other players in battles using these items for exciting rewards. The project is the first grant recipient from the Poolz Grant Program.<br> This project possesses top-notch graphics that are equally sharp and sophisticated in each design. There are 3 different modes of gameplay: PvE, PvP, and Boss Fighting. The three modes are included to grant diversity and enjoyment for players. A collection of 16 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Cards allows players to complete a set of four different Elementals in a game that will test not only skills but also strategy.
