Welcome to The Killa Koliseum!<br> <br> What are we?<br> At the core, The Killa Koliseum is a competitive game based on strategic decision-making. We will offer a collection of 10,420 NFTs built on the Ethereum network. Each Killa is completely unique and verifiable on the blockchain as an ERC-721 token. **Possessing a token of a Killa will give permission to the owner to register their Killa in 1v1 fights, where two Killas will battle to the death in the arena, publicly available for viewing on our website.** Pick your weapon and fighting style, and we will register your Killa randomly in a battle with an evenly matched Killa.<br> <br> Our smart contract programs for each Killa to be 1 of 5 character classes: Soldier, Tank, Mage, Trickster, and Peasant. Each Class fights distinctively, and each Killa possesses unique hit points which will determine its success in battle. Our smart contract also programs for each Killa to display 6 properties. These properties include Headwear, Armor, Eyes, Mouth, Skin, and Background. There are over 110 attributes in total. Community and project priorities will be voted on in full by all Killas.
