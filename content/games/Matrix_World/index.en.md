Matrix World is a decentralized open virtual world that enables users to interact with 3D immersive<br> applications while simultaneously running on different blockchains. The world is made up of Lands,<br> which are issued as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and permanently persisted on blockchain<br> networks such as Ethereum and Flow. Thus, the Matrix Lands are tradable and transferable via<br> blockchain networks, and their owners retain complete control over the creations on their Lands.<br> More technically, Lands can be bounded to a sandbox in Matrix Network, and the sandbox has its<br> own compute and storage resources. These resources allow the landowner and creators to govern<br> the visual appearance, inner properties, and lifecycle logic of the Land's creations, ultimately<br> resulting in the production of a 3D immersive application that can operate in perpetuity in the<br> Matrix cyberspace.<br> In Matrix World, users can take advantage of traditional 3D open-world features such as building<br> 3D architectures, hosting virtual meetings, exhibiting digital assets (e.g., NFTs), and more advanced<br> functionality such as creating and hosting their own 3D decentralized applications (DApps) using<br> Matrix's built-in creator services and computational resources. These DApps include 3D games and<br> 3D marketplaces, among others. Our ultimate goal is to create unlimited possibilities and<br> opportunities for metaverse by eliminating the boundary between multiple blockchains and<br> building a next-generation 3D open-world DApp platform on top of Matrix World.
