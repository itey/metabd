Each season has a different hidden system that calculates what happens in the race. <br> <br> Once a new season begins, the previous systems rules are revealed and players can choose which type of rules they would like to race in.<br> <br> Each Season ends with 4 Massive Races, the Nova Rally Championship. One for each league. The best of the best from each division compete for the ultimate prize.
