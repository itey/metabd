CryptoKitties is a game centered around breedable, collectible, and oh-so-adorable creatures we call CryptoKitties! Each cat is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by you; it cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed.<br> <br> In CryptoKitties you can breed and adopt Kitties of all colours and shapes. Create Collections of your favourite cats and share them with our breeding community.
