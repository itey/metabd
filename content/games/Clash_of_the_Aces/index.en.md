The inspiration and creation behind Clash of the Aces (CoA) came from a mixture of Destiny, APEX Legends, and Overwatch.<br> <br> Our vision for this game was to create a first-person shooter which focused heavily on PvP and e-sports, but also provide PvE aspects such as missions, a story, planets to explore, and much more.<br> <br> The game mechanics of CoA are similar to Pathfinders in that items have Common, Rare, Legendary, and Exotic rarity and that EverVerse items can be used across both games.
