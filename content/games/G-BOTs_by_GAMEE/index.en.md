G-Bots are Polygon-based NFTs (using ERC-721 standard) designed to provide the ultimate Play &amp; Earn experience in the new era of gaming. <br> <br> Our main goal is to create a decentralized platform that enables players to participate in its success, make decisions around the game and earn income in various ways.<br> <br> Players will be able to upgrade their NFTs, play games, stake &amp; earn rewards, access exclusive content and benefits, or challenge other players in PvP fights within the G-Bots Metaverse. <br> <br> Eventually, the G-Bots Metaverse will have decentralized ownership, starting from G-Bots game characters and continuing to various game-related real estate, whose owners will shape the future and experience of the game.
