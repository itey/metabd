CityStates is a strategy, city building and resource management MMO where all in-game assets (like Wood, Stone, Food, Weapons, Armor etc) are also issued on a public ledger (blockchain). Players can trade what they gather in the game with other players, creating the first real player driven economy by demand and supply.
