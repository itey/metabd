Starbots is a BattleBots-inspired universe and the first-ever robot battle NFT game where players create fantasy robots to fight against other competitors, then collect NFT items and $GEAR tokens.<br> <br> Robots come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The body, weapon, gadget, and wheels are the four components of a complete robot. Players are allowed to collect these various parts, build and power up their own robots.
