Players joining ASPO World are required to choose one of the three classes ASPO has designed (Fighter, Hunter and Witch) as their main character along with 4 four other companions (spirits) to form a strong team in the arena. By engaging in the battles and activities, players can claim NFTs that can be traded on Marketplace. Players in ASPO World do not individually go on the journey on their own but with other companions. In particular, we are developing the “Guild” feature to create better player connections. In the future, we expect to organize tournaments for the whole community of ASPO to join, making the game as interactive as possible. We create ASPO World with the aim of promoting Vietnamese NFT games to the global playing field and we hope to put players as the center of this and all of our next games.<br> <br> Play Mode<br> <br> We have PvE, PvP, and guild battle modes. In addition, we also have NFT dungeons for players to fight bosses and hunt items.<br> <br> Play to Earn Model<br> <br> ASPO World is going to be an exemplary of the play to earn model (P2E model) in this era of digital assets. Players in ASPO World can engage in the daily activities and PvP battles to claim items, whose values are determined by its rarity. They can then trade them on the Marketplace to earn money.<br> <br> Highlight Features<br> We feature fair PVP competition. This feature will help the following newcomers not lose their advantage over the previous players. When playing PVP, all will be equal in strength. At this time, players rely heavily on tactics and wisdom to ban and choose generals, build a squad based on tactical thinking to defeat the opponent. In addition, if you hate any type of champion, you can also ban those generals.
