Kart Racing League is a play-to-earn kart racing game similar to Axie Infinity, but features engaging Mario Kart-style gameplay with 3D NFT characters. These characters can be evolved, which creates a new NFT with an upgraded look and attributes (like speed, acceleration, etc.).<br> <br> The game lets players face-off online in intense multiplayer racing, across brilliant tracks, collecting power-ups and speed boosts along the way and earning EoC and KRL tokens! KRL tokens are currently in pre-sale, and these are the governance tokens for the game similar to Axie's AXS shards. <br> The 3D NFT Racer characters are required to play the game and are currently on sale now at:<br> https://marketplace.kartracingleague.com/<br> <br> Kart Racing League consists of "seasons" that last for roughly 10 weeks. These seasons introduce a new race track, along with a new chapter in the game's storyline and massive KRL token prize pools to be won.<br> <br> Join the Kart Racing League at:<br> https://kartracingleague.com/
