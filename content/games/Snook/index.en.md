Snook is a unique NFT Game. It's like Snake much like Bruce Banner is like the Hulk. A kill-or-be-killed adrenaline charged multiplayer game that is pioneering NFT game characters. That means players' performance directly affects the NFT face value - or if you play an awesome game you'll make a killing.
