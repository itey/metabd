A Metaverse of play2earn games where players will be able to interact in realtime and socialize with each other using their nft avatars , voice chats , emotes and participate in events and activities together . Our platform will also host various genres of P2E games (we have currently planned 3 games) to cater to all different kinds of players and bring them together in one app/platform.
