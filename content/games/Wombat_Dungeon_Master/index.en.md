Dungeon Master takes you to the other side of adventures! This time, YOU are in charge of a dungeon and rewards, sending cute wombats on perilous quests.<br> <br> Hide NFT loot and open your dungeons for the wombats to lurk around and seek it. The bigger is the mining power of hidden NFTs, the more points the wombats will get. It is in your best interest, Dungeon Master, that they earn a lot — these points translate into your crypto rewards at the end of each season!
