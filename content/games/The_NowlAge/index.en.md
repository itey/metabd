The NowlAge is an Online Collectible NFT Cards game building on the Binance Smart Chain. <br> <br> There are more than 40,000 unique cards in Nowlage which can be minted and are user-owned BSC-721 NFTs that can be freely traded with other players. <br> <br> To remove the possibility for scams when conducting trades through the NFT contracts, The NowlAge has a proprietary marketplace where users may list and purchase their NFTs.<br> <br> The NowlAge Game has two types of combat: PVE (Player vs Environment) and PVP (Player vs Player), where you can farm items and NAC Tokens that will allow you to advance in the game and develop The NowlAge's economy.<br> <br> $NAC is the primary utility token of The NowlAge ecosystem. It simplifies the payment process and supports the growth of The NowlAge ecosystem.<br> <br> Currently, the following options are available for the player to earn:<br> -Participating in combat through the use of Guardian NFTs for $NAC.<br> -Minting Guardians and selling them for $NAC on the marketplace.<br> -Trading NFTs with other players for BEP-20 tokens.<br> -Exchanging $NAC on a DEX for a currency that can be traded on an exchange such as Binance.
