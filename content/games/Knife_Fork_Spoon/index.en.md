KFS is not just another Blockchain Game.<br> We’re a collection of 1212 silverware seeking to be the “Mario party of solana”, developing the Spoonverse – a platform of community-building mini-games for all Solana NFTs. <br> <br> Best of all we’ve already developed and shipped a Battle Royale mini-game, playable in the week following mint.<br> <br> An autonomous Mini-game where holders strategically build teams to battle one another to contest for the massive weekly prize pools.
