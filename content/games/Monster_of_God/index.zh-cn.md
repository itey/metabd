Monster Of God (MOGWAR) is a strategy game combining Idle RPG specials and Autobattler. It is connected with blockchain technology, in which players can earn Monster Soul Potion (MSP) through PvP/PvE battles among Monsters and collect MONX coins through in-game tournament rewards. MOGWAR is completely free to play and you really play to earn. MOGWAR allows players to collect MSP coins and trade NFT monsters. Mix and match monsters to create a new offspring of NFT for the first time.
