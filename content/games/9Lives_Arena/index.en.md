9lives Arena is a competitive online RPG focused on skill based one versus one PvP featuring permadeath, persistent progression, resource gathering, item crafting and the world's first online/offline companion, Ooogy, that works for you 24/7.<br> <br> In 9LA there are no fixed classes. You have complete freedom to create the hero of your dreams. <br> <br> Developing your character doesn't take months. It takes just a few hours, and over time the process of making a new hero is sped up significantly, thanks to the underlying persistent progression. Level up by fighting in the training arena where you can't lose any lives. Gain talent points and valuable loot after each fight. Use the talent points to further customize your spells and abilities. <br> <br> Once your hero reaches Level 30 and you have equipped him with the best skills, abilities and gear - then its time to enter the Inferno arena where you fight with your 9 lives. <br> â€‹<br> How many victories will your hero achieve with 9 lives?
