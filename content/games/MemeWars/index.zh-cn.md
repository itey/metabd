The first ever DeFi game that allows players to strategically stake, defend and attack enemy staking pools.<br> <br> MemeWars is an exciting, cutting-edge blockchain game based entirely on-chain with no off-chain logic whatsoever. The entire game is decentralized and permissionless, creating a first-of-its-kind crypto game that will run autonomously with no assistance needed from the dev team after it’s launch (although, improvements can be made). <br> <br> This new type of “decentralized gaming” is different from most of the leading GameFi projects on the market today, which require ongoing dev team support, as well as some off-chain logic to make them run.<br> <br> MemeWars is built on Binance Smart Chain, and uses only a single currency, the $MWAR token. Unlike most play-to-earn models, MemeWars requires players to stake and burn their tokens in order to participate in the game, creating a new type of GameFi concept called “Burn-to-Earn”.<br> <br> Game Concept:<br> There are three teams, or “nations” as they are called in the game — Pepe Clan, Shiba Army, and the Wojak Union. Each nation is represented by a geographic location on the MemeWars map.<br> <br> Users will stake their coins into a nation of their choice, and are given ownership in that nation and voting rights as well. The rewards earned each round are proportional to the ownership size in that nation/pool.<br> Stakers also get to decide where their “stake weight” is directed in the nation — Defense, Attack or Production.<br> <br> Attack — Higher attack points allow the nation, in an offensive attack to “loot” more of the enemy nation’s MWAR stores.<br> Defense — Higher defense points protect the produced MWAR of that nation.<br> Production — Higher production points mean more MWAR is minted by this nation for rewards.<br> The allocations of a nation’s staked MWAR in these three sub-pools will dictate how the nation fares during times of peace, defense and offensive battles (Each cycle is 3 days).
