We’ve developed a web-based racing game that simulates real-time races, leveraging car stats, and tracks properties to mention some variables.<br> <br> To play the game and join tournaments, users need to create an account in CryptoMotors, link a digital wallet to the platform, and have at least one NFT car in their garage.<br> <br> For the first time ever, users will be able to participate in competitive races using their own unique CryptoMotors cars. Players that don’t have an NFT car can borrow vehicles from other users.<br> <br> There will be weekly, monthly, and special weekend tournaments. Players will earn points by winning races, and compete to get to the top spots in the leaderboards.
