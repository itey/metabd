CITIZENS OF EARTH, WELCOME TO FUR BRAWLS!<br> <br> The arrival of Super Bunnies changed the face of our metaverse.<br> <br> Many people welcomed these cute superheroes..<br> Others were skeptical, and right to be - noting that some bunnies have a much darker side...<br> <br> As their powers grew so did the problems, when some bunnies turned into tigers, the world understood there would have to be leaders...<br> <br> Now, they must fight.<br> <br> Launching late August 2021 with Super Bunnies which sold out in hours, the team at Fur Brawls have always pushed what is possible with a generative art collection.<br> <br> Innovations like having two opposing teams, and stats that can be improved in our games, have successfully moved the project into the crypto gaming space.<br> <br> This has been welcomed and supported by our amazing community, and will ensure - with the first of many games in development already - that Fur Brawls has a long successful life.
