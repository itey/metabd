Welcome to the Daily Strategists Tournament. Start planning your defense layout by placing 4 types of basic towers that will prevent orcs from reaching the Realmâ€™s walls. Orcs will come in endless waves of increasing difficulty. When you reach Wave 10, you will be asked to evaluate your strategy and decide whether to redefine it all over from scratch or participate in the Daily Strategists Tournament by paying the tournament entry fee.
