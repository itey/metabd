KOMBAT is an internal game's token. KOMBATs can be traded on exchanges as well as used in YeldFarming. KOMBATs can be staked in contract to receive rewards in VOMBATs. And VOMBAT is needed in order to mint NFT cards of your favorite heroes. Each crypto-hero card has 4 levels of a rarity - Genesis, Epic, Rare and Common. The last three types can be received by each player by accumulating the required number of VOMBATs. Genesis cards are issued in one copy and must be transferred to those who are depicted on them.
