PyMons, limited in quantity yet unlimited in strength, are dystopian creatures that come from afar. PyMons are truly creatures of war; they do not battle for fun, but rather for survival. Being the owner of your own PyMon, it is up to you to collect and play your PyMons strategically. Whether you play with fire, water, or wind is completely up to you; climb your way up the leaderboard and reap the fortunes that await!
