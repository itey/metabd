How it works?<br> NiftyVille is a place where you get to be you. But the extraordinary is always just around the corner! Demolition Derbies, Races, Zombie Parties... anything can happen in the world's first play-to-earn open world game. Coming soon to the Ethereum network.<br> <br> What is the game?<br> NiftyVille is a town of endless possibilities... just as real-life is. If you can imagine it... you can do it in NiftyVille! Explore the town. Thereâ€™s people to meet. Shops to visit. And lots of things to do.<br> Meet up with old friends, make new ones, and roam the streets... use the town map to become acquainted with all the events and activities going on, initiated either by the server, by other players... or even by you!<br> <br> What am I in the game?<br> You can be whatever you want... a business owner, a hitman, a thief, or just your ordinary self. It all comes down to your imagination and your ability to bring that imagination to the fore in NiftyVille.<br> <br> Within the game, players get the chance to buy properties, which, like many things in NiftyVille, are NFTs. Owning a shop means being rewarded with the in-game currency NiftyCoins and exclusive NFTs for you to sell.<br> <br> If cars are your thing, for example, buy yourself a car dealership and get rewarded with exotic car NFTs available only to you.
