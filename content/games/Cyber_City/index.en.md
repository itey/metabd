In the not-so-distant future, Cyber City dominates the planet, and corporations run the world.<br> These corporations control all the wealth and resources, leaving the inhabitants of the City in a dire existence. Cyber City streets are ugly, cruel, and dangerous. A perfect environment for the strongest and most cunning to claw their way to the top.<br> <br> The year 2088 - a world without borders cultural and national. Corporate greed, ever-increasing consumption, ecological disasters, wars, and technological advancement of the 20th and 21st century turned the planet into a wasteland covered by a seemingly infinite Megapolis of slumps. An Urban “Hell” of the megacity is the new physical reality. <br> <br> But there is another, digital reality, an unregulated widespread access to the World Wide Web created a new plane of existence, a mix of the Physical and Digital existence of humans. One dire, ugly with scarce resources, another with the “infinite possibility and unimaginable freedom". <br> <br> Gameplay<br> - A wild mix between RPG, Strategy and Turn-based Combat with some cool minigame mechanics<br> - Control and fight for territories to farm resources<br> - Fight in the arena<br> - Race and wager in companion races<br> - Trade in and outside the game<br> - Form bands, guilds and alliances to dominate the land<br> - Forge epic relics and gear<br> - Build and develop your land
