Star Atlas is a massively-multiplayer online metaverse. In the distant future, three galactic factions have emerged, in an ongoing struggle for resources, territorial conquest, and political domination. Players can join a faction, directly influence the course of the metaverse, and earn real-world income for their contributions.
