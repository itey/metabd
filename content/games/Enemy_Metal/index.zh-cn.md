The most ambitious part of the Enemy Metal adventure is the arcade game, which will give players the chance to collect resources and battle the deadly enemy on each of the planets of the Sunstar System. The team has already developed an exciting gameplay prototype.<br> <br> Simple to play, yet difficult to master, the game combines the addictive entertainment of classic arcade games with modern graphics, audio, and physics systems. The unique gameplay features automated planetary defense systems and dangerous enemies, and all of the action takes place on spherical maps, leaving no place to run and no place to hide. It is an immersive experience filled with possibilities.
