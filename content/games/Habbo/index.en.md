WHAT IS HABBO?<br> Habbo is an online vintage pixel-art style virtual community where you can create your own avatar, make friends, chat, build rooms, design + play games and so much more! Almost anything is possible in this strange place full of awesome people…<br> <br> MORE THAN JUST A GAME…<br> Styling your avatar in the most on-trend styles isn't the only way to have fun in Habbo. Want to be the architect of the century and build dazzling structures? Builders Club is for you! Want to show off your crazy game building skills and stump your friends? Join our competitions!<br> <br> THE HABBO AVATARS PROJECT<br> Habbos! We’ll be creating, or ‘minting’ roughly 11,600 unique, randomly generated Habbo avatars. We’re calling it the Habbo Avatars project.<br> <br> Initially, at least, these avatars will be bits of pixel art that can be bought with the cryptocurrency Ethereum.<br> <br> One of the coolest things about Habbo Avatars is that eventually, we plan to make each one of them usable in-game. When this happens, not only do we plan for them to have an exclusive effect – and a lot of the time, weird and wonderful exclusive items – we also plan to enable active Habbo Club and Builders Club memberships for their owners as a kind of perk.
