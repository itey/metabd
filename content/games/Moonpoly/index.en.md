Crypto Moonpoly First-NFT-economical and strategic online-3d-board game for 2-6 Players. The goal of the game is to invest crypto into the perspective crypto industry rationally. The start-up capital winner will be a player who will not lose everything on the cryptomarket. Players throw crypto dice to decide how many steps they will do with the NFT figure. <br> <br> When a player has a turn to walk, the Player throwing a dice determines how many steps he must make on the playing field during this turn (each step corresponds to one point on the die and one square on the playing field). To start or join a game, players must invest from a custom game pool 5% CMP tokens - game currency if the game mod is set for six players. If the game mod is set for Two players, each Player must invest 15% of the total pool. <br> Crypto Moonpoly also offers users to create their online-board-deck with newly invented rules and cards.
