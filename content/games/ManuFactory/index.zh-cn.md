ManuFactory is a construction and management game built in a sandbox. A state-of-the-art gameplay genre combined with the power of NFTs that bring a unique, high-quality experience never seen before. Players will be able to build up their lands, look for resources to build up automation processes and defenses, protect their assets from hordes of parasite monsters, and enjoy a true play and earn model, where they’ll be rewarded for their skills.<br> <br> ManuFactory is a game where you use digital assets to build up a factory and automate the extraction and processing of raw minerals, where outputs can be exchanged for crypto ($MNFT). The bigger the factory, the bigger the rewards. The game’s difficulty ramps up as factories become larger and generate more pollution, as the contamination attracts increasingly powerful monsters to try and destroy players’ assets. Gameplay revolves around the completion of tasks, which can either be performed manually, such as mining with an NFT pickaxe or shooting monsters with NFT weapons, or automated with NFTs such as excavation machines for mining or heat-sensor turrets for monster extermination. Players must cooperate with their teammates to strategize their operations and defenses, in order to grow a large factory and reap the rewards from effective teamwork and operations management.<br> <br> , ManuFactory differentiates itself from the rest of the Play2Earns because it will actually be an enjoyable game to play while earning crypto, opening opportunities to include sustainable revenue streams such as aesthetic NFTs (skins), game art NFTs, non-intrusive pixel art ads for other crypto projects, marketplace commissions, among other yet unannounced initiatives. We are also building a project around economic sustainability and investor confidence through transparency.
