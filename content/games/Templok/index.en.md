Tetris + Candy Crush + P2E = Templok!<br> <br> Place pieces on the board and make more room by clearing lines and columns.<br> <br> Clear the 3 slots to get the new batch of pieces.<br> <br> Use the circular container to hold the pieces fot later. You can use those pieces straight away, turn them or even transform them into new pieces.<br> <br> For each column and row you clear simultaneously you will receive a new Turn or Re-roll token.<br> <br> Once you can't place more pieces on the board or hold them, it will be game over.
