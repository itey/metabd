Hydraverse is a metaverse play-to-earn PVP dragon racing game. Players get the chance to open the dragon eggs, which later create unique dragons. These dragons can partake in the race and receive rewards for winning prizes. Players can also generate value by renting their own dragons or displaying them in the exhibition park.
