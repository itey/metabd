Katana Inu is a high-end graphics pc-game with play-to-earn mechanics and NFT integration. Play solo or deploy with your squad into an interactive open-world environment with NFT-based airdrops and other in-game items available to interact with. Trade or sell your in-game valuables on Katana Inu's (layer 2 solution) NFT marketplace. <br> <br> We are focused on merging the worlds of high-end graphics with blockchain gaming, something unheard of so far in the play-to-earn space. Our approach will allow players to enjoy the best of both worlds; visually pleasing aesthetic gameplay and ownership via NFT integration. <br> <br> In-game items are tradable NFTs, including random airdrops that players can receive live during a gameplay session. Play to earn, earn as you play; either way, you're in for a treat as you journey into the Katana Inu metaverse!
