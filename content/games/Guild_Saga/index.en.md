Guild Saga is a play-to-earn, NFT-based fantasy RPG built on the Solana blockchain. An isometric perspective and hand-drawn pixel art sprites complement strategic, turn-based, tactics-style combat heavily inspired by classics like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre as well as modern CRPGs like Divinity: Original Sin and Pillars of Eternity. Tokenized (NFT) loot, SPL-token currency, and play-to-earn mechanics provide players with true ownership over the spoils of their in-game achievements, thereby incentivizing exploration, completionism, build optimization, and frequent play.
