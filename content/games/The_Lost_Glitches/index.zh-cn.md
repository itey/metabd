The Lost Glitches — Syndicate Wars is a fusion of collectible card game (CCG) and a role playing game (RPG). All players will be able to join one of the Syndicates, craft their deck and earn experience and $LOST tokens to improve their character’s abilities and equipment to eventually conquer the virtual world of the Deep Sky!<br> <br> At its core, The Lost Glitches is a collectible card game, taking its cues from popular games in the genre. Players play in turns, casting their creatures and spells during their turn by consuming their available energy. To keep gameplay strategic and engaging, players can still cast spells during the other person’s turn. This is a very brief description of the gameplay as we will have much more to offer !<br> <br> We’re bringing character progression (RPG) to the genre. The experience of the player’s character increases with every win. And you can choose how to upgrade your spells to make your commander even more powerful on the battlefield. Also, you are gaining Syndicate points that you can spend in your syndicate to boost your district and unlock special abilities or bonuses for all the players of your syndicate.<br> <br> We’re also aiming to create a dynamic world of the Deep Sky, which will change based on gameplay. In its core, the game should be accessible with depth and progression for advanced players. Game styles will be strongly influenced by the syndicate the players choose to play with. So choose wisely, each syndicate is very unique!<br> <br> This is where it becomes even more interesting! You will have to choose one spell, which will be available to you at the start of the game. This spell will be upgradable based on your experience level (Reputation Level). Eventually, probably post release, we want to add more equipment for the character. In the same way character spells work, players will also be able to attach weapons, armor or other artifacts to their commander.<br> <br> And even more!
