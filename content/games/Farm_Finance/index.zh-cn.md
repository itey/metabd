Farm Finance is based on ideas from a famous farming game years ago on Zing Me. Combined with NFT's Blockchain technology, you can play to earn from now on - which allow you can create your finance from your own farm. <br> <br> Our mission : <br> We understand players want to "play &amp; earn" a game with stablization - Not only with reward but also market price is matter as well - A successful game will be decided how strong community is. This is going to be a tough challenge but we will try our best.<br> <br> In addition to, Graphic design and interface must be in harmony. Everything have to bring to players a feeling that they're actually enjoy it. Along with community features we're about to introduce, player will think they are becoming a real farmer.
