MicroPets’ Game Idea The basic idea with MicroPets Runner is a classic side-scrolling runner wherein game users will proceed with their game character (a MicroPets NFT product) picking up coins (to earn rewards) on their way past monsters and obstacles as they advance along a map.<br> <br> Users will also grab power-ups that enhance their earning power that can save their lives. The game is being built for both Android and iOS.<br> <br> Why MicroPets Selected Cubix as Its Game Development Partner Having worked with brands like Walmart, Sapient, Politico and more, Cubix is an established and a serious product development partner. With more than 200 global team members, MicroPets detected strong indicators that Cubix would be the right game development company to partner with.<br> <br> Many of the stakeholders and product strategists at Cubix are P2E game enthusiasts themselves, which says a lot about their expertise and ability to critique games, and therefore advise clients in terms of technologies and business dynamics.<br> <br> MicroPets believes it has selected a premium game developer with a thorough professional approach, which ensures a great deal of encouragement and enthusiasm for MicroPets’ followers. Only an experienced game developer like Cubix with a track record of roaring success can meet and exceed expectations compared to other options available.<br> <br> Moreover, when a game development company specializes in blockchain development as a major business solution, this is precisely what a client would need given the scale of monetary and time investment.
