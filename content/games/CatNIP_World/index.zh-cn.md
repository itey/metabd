CatNIP Battler is a cat collection and battle game.<br> Players choose 3 cats from their collection and enter various regions to battle against other cats. Within the region, 3 cats with random rarity and stats will spawn from the regionâ€™s pool.<br> <br> At the end of each battle, the player gets to choose a cat that they defeated and add it to their collection.<br> <br> The game utilizes the NIP token as a payment method to enter battles. By the end of each battle, the player will be guaranteed 1 cat of various rarity to be minted as an NFT which the player can use in future battles.<br> <br> The NIP used as the entry fee goes towards the cost of the<br> NFT. The entry fees are purchased as a ticket bundle. The<br> cost of a ticket is subtracted from the cost of the NFT.
