Spirit Clash is a battle for supremacy. You must clash your way through the three spiritual cores of Mind, Body, and Soul to claim victory. The first player to control two of the cores wins the game, but your opponent won't let you take them easily. Summon Followers that will clash for your Overlord. Cast Hexes to hinder your enemies or to help yourself. Equip powerful Relics. Order clashes upon the cores to become the most powerful Overlord and reign supreme.
