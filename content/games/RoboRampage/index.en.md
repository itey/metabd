Collect. Build. Destroy.<br> Players collect robots (Rampagers). Improve their Rampager by adding weapons, armor, driving<br> skills, and other items, owning every piece of their Rampager as a collectible asset.<br> <br> The goal is to build the best damn robot you can assemble. Once it’s ready, there’s no working<br> together to bring peace to the universe and build a community of harmony.<br> <br> The time is upon you to seek out your opponents and destroy them!<br> Robo Rampage consists of two components: A Strategy Fighting Game and a Collectible Game.<br> <br> Rampagers challenge random opponents or a specific user, seeking to defeat them and own a<br> piece of their fallen enemy forever. But be careful; losing a battle may mean losing a piece of<br> your Rampager. And what’s gone is gone for good.<br> <br> If one opponent isn’t enough, throw your hat in the ring against nine other competitors in a<br> winner-take-all Robo Royale.
