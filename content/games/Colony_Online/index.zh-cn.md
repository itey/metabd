Colonists are an NFT collection of 25,000 unique, programmatically generated space animals that are redeemable for their in-game playable character and cosmetic items in our upcoming MMO on the blockchain.<br> <br> They come in 5 different species, with a hard-capped supply of 5,000 per species. Each species is dropped one by one, and is only available to mint once the previously dropped species has sold out.<br> <br> Colony Online is a social MMO (Metaverse) on the blockchain where all playable characters and in-game cosmetic items are NFTs.<br> <br> The game takes place on an alternate-reality Moon Colony, where a society of randomly generated space animals (called Colonists) have colonized the moon and turned it into their very own social playground for chic materialism, party lifestyle, and moon mining.<br> <br> This world will have its very own cryptocurrency to fuel an economy of in-game item ownership on the blockchain.
