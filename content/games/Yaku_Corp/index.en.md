We wanted to create our own universe in a cyberpunk world with the finest Japanese legends and Geeks winks. or that, we surrounded ourselves with talented mangakas and 2D animators for the creation of a manga and an anime. As well as 3D &amp; Unreal Engine developers for the creation of characters, weapons, vehicles based on our history … Fully usable in the metaverse or in a future video game.
