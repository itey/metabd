A crypto farm where NFTs represent real products from real farms. The NFTs of this collection represent the tools that, every day, accompany the farmers in their hard work. By putting these tools together it is possible to generate new NFTs that are linked to real goods and products from our farms. Ownership of these NFTs therefore guarantees ownership of these products.<br> <br> Get a chicken coop, a barn and a few chickens... And begin your adventure in the lands of Farming Tales.<br> <br> Use your "Custom Character" to create a unique and inimitable NFT, to be included in the world of Farming Tales.
