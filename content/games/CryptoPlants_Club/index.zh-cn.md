CryptoPlants Club will be using $CPC as its governance token and a secondary coin for rewarding players that is tied to a stable coin like USDT. By doing this, we believe we can revolutionize oracle based games and pioneer a new kind of Play-to-Earn Experience.<br> <br> There will be a 60% withdrawal fee (having 4% less each day until the 15th day), you will be able to withdraw tax-free after the 15th day. In conjunction with this, you will be able to withdraw twice a month without penalties, the third time will incur a penalty in the form of a withdrawal lock for a month (30 calendar days).<br> <br> As part of our burning mechanism you have to be aware of Crows and Locusts. Crows pause plant production while Locusts decrease harvest at the end of cycle. You need to take care of them to ensure a profitable yield.<br> <br> There will be systems to be implemented further in the future to add both to the gameplay and liquidity to the rewards pool.<br> <br> An oracle based farm game that utilizes a main token for in-game purchases and a secondary stable coin for payouts.
