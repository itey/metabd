Every time the towerâ€™s height changes, the struggle begins. Is it worth destroying previously built block or wait until the height increases?<br> <br> What time is the best for building a new block? Fear of losing can push one to waste the perfect moment.<br> <br> Will the tower get higher or not? Open your mind and try to predict.
