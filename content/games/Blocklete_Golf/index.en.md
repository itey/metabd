Blocklete Games™ is a first of its kind online golf game! Blocklete Games™ is built on blockchain technology. The big difference between our blockchain-based game and the games you might be used to? You own your golfer! Use it to compete in tournaments, trade it, give it away, or sell it to another player – the choice is yours. Pretty cool!
