VINchain is a decentralized blockchain database that records all relevant information pertaining to vehicles. For each vehicle, a blockchain passport is issued which will be stored in a distributed registry. VINchain is also capable of producing reports that can be ordered immediately by buyers, sellers, and other market participants.Information about the vehicle is accumulated in the databases of all system participants (manufacturers, insurance companies, service stations, banks and leasing companies, dealers, etc.) during the entire period of its use.
