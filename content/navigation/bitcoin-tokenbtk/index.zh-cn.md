Bitcoin Token (BTK) is a digital currency. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions are carried out collectively by the network. There is no central control over the token. Bitcoin Token is open source, community driven, decentralized. Developers are all volunteers.
Bitcoin Token is working towards mass-adoption of the use of the currency in real-life applications. From encouraging local busineses to accept BitcoinToken as a method of payment, we are also looking to impliment our currency into many already heavily used ecommerce scripts. And on the user level being able to share money, wire money, or just send a gift to a friend, BTK will make this possible.
