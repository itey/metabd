description: "Staking third party NFTs on the R-Planet website to accumulate Aether (AETH) is almost a right of passage on the WAX blockchain. Hosting dozens of projects and hundreds of thousands of NFTs, R-Planet was once the darling of the WAX community. And though things change slowly in the lands of R-Planet, change they do. And soon, third party staking as we know it will change to a player governed system."
