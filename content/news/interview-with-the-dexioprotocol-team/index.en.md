description: "A couple months ago we introduced Dexioprotocol ¨C a crypto-based gaming company with several utilities, including an upcoming AR-mobile game, wallet, and soon-to-be-released blockchain, the Smart Dexio Network (SDN). Most recently, the project announced several releases through the month of April, which may include an entirely new wallet with a web version, browser extension, and integrated swap, play-to-earn and player-vs-player mechanics to their DexiKnights game, and a yet-to-be-named second game. All of this before their flagship offering, DexiHunter (think Pok¨Śmon-Go for crypto) enters its beta version, which will go-live in five cities across the globe."
