Independent developer Boss Cannon today announced the incoming partnership with Polygon Studios to address the environmental impact of NFTs for their brand new arena card battle game, Wrejects. This partnership will also allow users to mint and trade NFTs for minimal gas fees.

<!--more-->

On March 31st, via OpenSea Marketplace and Wrejects.com, the Wrejects Series 1 NFT collection will be released on the Polygon blockchain. The choice of Polygon over Ethereum will allow for cheap and energy efficient NFT transactions. NFT minting using Polygon will generate less than 1% of the carbon emission that it currently produces on the standard Ethereum blockchain.

> “With lower gas fees, we hope to make purchases easier for our customers with > our affordable NFT collections. We hate the thought of people paying more in gas > than for their actual items, and Polygon allows us to do that,”
>
> Casey Copeland, CEO of Wrejects

## What is Wrejects?

Billed as Garbage Pail Kids meets turn-based Street Fighter with the added mix of a distinctive art style and an innovative play-to-earn system. Built on the Polygon blockchain, Wrejects allows players to collect and fight with NFT cards of characters, items and arenas all the while earning Painium ($PAIN), the in-game token, through playing the game.

Choose your fighter from a unique roster of characters: from well-rounded Corp Bots to tactically diverse Wrejects – each with their own unique fighting style and attributes – to be your champion. Fights are simulated between player-managed NFT characters so preparation and strategy is the key to success. Choose your fighter, kit them out and watch them battle for the winner’s purse of valuable Painium tokens.

Wrejects is developed by Boss Cannon, an art collective made up of professional illustrators, painters, product designers, videographers, copywriters, and other artsy-fartsy titles. We think they create cool stuff and hope you think so too!
