**Community Gaming is [hosting](https://blog.communitygaming.io/community-gaming-partners-with-the-maker-foundation-and-theta-network/) three esports tournaments supported by blockchain technology, starting on January 30th. These tournaments will have price pools powered by MakerDAO, and will be streamed on Theta.tv. All tournament prizes will automatically be paid out by Community Gaming thanks to their blockchain technology.**

MakerDAO and Theta are two of the latest partners for the tournament platform Community Gaming. The organization started a couple of years ago with physical events, and last year the development of blockchain tools for online tournaments accelerated.

On January 30th a League of Legends tournament will start. It’s a free to enter competition with a 1200 DAI, which is 1200 dollars, prize pool. The top eight teams will automatically receive their payout at the end of the tournament thanks to Community Gaming’s Autopay Technology. After this event there will be an [Axie Infinity](https://www.playtoearn.online/?s=axie+infinity) tournament in the middle of February, while the third gaming partner still needs to be revealed. [Check out their website here](https://communitygaming.io/).

### How does this work?

Every player and or team will need to register themselves for a tournament, while also providing an Ethereum wallet address. After each match, both teams or players need to communicate the final score. They can provide proof, like for example a screenshot. As competitors advance through the brackets, ultimately it will be clear who’s the winner.

That’s where the Autopay Technology from Community Gaming kicks in. As soon as all results are confirmed by the players and/or tournament organizers, the prize pool will be split among all winners. In the case of League of Legends the system will instantly payout the prize money to forty players.
