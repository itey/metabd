**Blockchain video game studio Blockade Games has [received](https://medium.com/blockadegames/blockade-games-raises-5m-at-23m-valuation-a717dfa78c6a) a $5 million investment from Animoca Brands and various other investors to expand the Neon District universe. The team plans to add new in-game functionalities and introduce new assets into the ecosystem.**

At the moment Neon District exists as a tactical turn-based cyberpunk RPG on the Polygon blockchain. The game has a user base of 100,000 players strong, while 11 thousand new players joined in the past month. Ever since the launch of Season 1 on the Polygon blockchain, more than 2.1 million NFT assets have been minted. These assets are spread out over 177 thousand different wallets.

The numbers aside, Neon District still has a way to go to reach its full potential. Just [recently they introduced](https://www.playtoearn.online/2021/08/27/neon-district-finally-getting-season-zero-nfts/) a method to import the Season 0 items from Ethereum mainnet onto Polygon. In the coming weeks there’s a lot more to come. Blockade Games will give Neon District Trophy and Key holders early access to Neon District Version 2.0. After that the game will have its public release, which will also take place this year. To add some more excitement, Blockade Games will launch the first Neon District expansion set, ‘End of Days’. There will be a limited edition loot crate containing only weapons.

## Neon District roadmap

Next year there there’s a lot more in the pipeline for Neon District and its players as they will have another content update, Rags of Riches. The team also hired extra developers to work on new game modes and campaigns. In addition there will be a PVP arena, and the game itself will get a proper setting with land and a universe. Whether there will be a land sale, remains to be seen.

Blockade Games wants to work with designers to launch limited edition fashion items, allowing game characters to look dope as F while shooting or hacking their enemies.

## What is Neon District?

Neon District is a cyberpunk-themed turn based role playing game. The story-driven game takes place in a dystopian future. Player are part of a rebellion fighting an authoritarian regime. Players get to level up their characters by doing missions, while they have a chance of obtaining better gear as well.

A closed test version came available for founders token holders [in December](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/12/10/neon-district-to-release-early-version-next-week/) 2020. During Spring 2021 Neon District introduced more missions. This traditional singleplayer experience was the original vision for the game. Completing missions will earn players NEON as well.

Thanks to the integration with the Polygon blockchain, these game assets can be traded freely on an in-game marketplace. That way gamers don’t have to deal with gas fees while playing Neon District. Players can acquire gear through gameplay. They also need these digital items to progress in the game.

Neon District is a web-only experience, and everything works on both desktop and mobile devices. In the future they also want to make the game available through a standalone app for mobile devices.
