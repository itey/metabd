description: "Not long ago, CryptoBlades was the darling of the play-to-earn scene. But alas, their meteoric rise was not sustainable, and they crashed back down again, shedding players and token value. Luckily for everyone, CryptoBlades was never meant as a cash grab, and they have continued with their plans of building a guild vs guild game. Now, at long last, players can purchase tracts of land for CryptoBlades: Kingdoms from this sale and establish their domain!"
