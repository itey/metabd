**World-famous music artist Deadmau5 will have another NFT drop with Blankos Block Party. Dan Lish made the Day of the Deadmau5 x Blankos Collection in collaboration with the dj, and it includes the Get Lit Blanko and four wearables. These NFT items will drop on October 27th at 3PM PDT in both [the official shop](https://blankos.com/shop/) and in-game.**

These items will be very limited in supply. There will only be 1000 Get Lit Blankos available. Because of this limited availability, these character NFTs will cost $349.99 each or 35.000 Blanko Bucks. In case you didn’t know, you can earn Blanko Bucks by completing in-game challenges.

Furthermore there will be items for your character’s wrists, neck, shoes and a jetpack. Each with different price tags and supplies. For example, there will be 1500 jetpacks and these cost $149.99 each, while the 2000 high-tops shoes go for $49.99. With a $35 price the neck accessory is also quite pricey, even though the item has no supply limit. The wrist items will cost $25, also without limited mint quantities.

Deadmau5 will showcase the new items any time soon. So check out [the Twitch live stream](https://twitch.tv/deadmau5). This is actually the second time Deadmau5 sells an NFT for Blankos. They [announced](https://www.playtoearn.online/2021/06/14/deadmau5-and-burberry-coming-to-blankos-this-summer/) the first one during E3 2021.

## What is Blankos Block Party?

[Blankos Block Party](https://www.playtoearn.online/tag/blankos-block-party/) is an open-world multiplayer game styled like a giant block party. The game has a focus on building, exploration and curating your collection of unique and rare Blankos. The game is coming to PC, but will very likely also make an appearance on console systems. Blankos Block Party is using the blockchain technology from EOSIO, similar to EOS and WAX.

Blankos Block Party is a party game in which users can enjoy curated and user generated content. This can range from races to shooting challenges, from platforming to other crazy stuff. Users can build creations on the fly using assets available to them, while venturing into new adventures with their personally owned Blankos characters. Blankos Block Party focuses on user generated content, and it introduces a frictionless [NFT Marketplace](https://www.playtoearn.online/tag/nft-marketplace/).

Blankos uses the so-called dGoods format for its NFTs. The team at Mythical has build their dGoods system in such a way that NFTs can move across different chains. Because this way they want to make sure that the technology doesn’t limit the liquidity for players.
