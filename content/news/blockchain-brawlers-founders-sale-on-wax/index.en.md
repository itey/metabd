**After a hugely successful [sale for its initial Founders NFTs on Binance](https://www.playtoearn.online/2021/12/08/blockchain-brawlers-first-founders-nfts-on-binance/), the WAX-based project, Blockchain Brawlers, brings its Founders NFT sale back home. Each one is a unique, 1 of 1 item. Only 400 of these Founder’s Edition NFTs will ever exist.**

The WAX auctions have started already and will continue to be added over the coming days until all of them are sold. Bids start at 1000 WAX, so don’t expect to get any of these Legendary Founders NFTs for cheap. One of the rarest Brawlers went for $42,000 USD during the Binance sale!

Each Brawler comes in four editions, Standard, Hardcore, Cage Match, and Death Match. Each edition has a different background and some changes to the Brawler’s costume. These are the last of the ‘Founder’s Edition’ Brawlers. No more will be made. What perks the owners receive are somewhat unclear, but holding a unique, limited-edition NFT is often well-rewarded by blockchain games. Winning bidders also receive a common Ring NFT, guaranteeing that they will be ready to play when the game launches.

The Blockchain Brawlers team revealed some additional information about their upcoming pack sale. From February 8 to February 10th, Ring Packs and Gear Packs go up for sale on the WAX blockchain. There will be 1000 packs of each kind costing, $100 apiece. There will also be Brawler packs for sale containing three possible rarities, common, uncommon, and rare.

## What is Blockchain Brawlers?

Developed by WAX Studios, an offshoot of the official WAX organization, [Blockchain Brawlers](https://www.bcbrawlers.com/) is an upcoming play to earn game. Looking like a mixture of WWE, Mexican wrestling, and cage match brawls, Blockchain brawlers brings some some wrestling zaniness to the gaming world.

Expected to launch in Q1 on 2022, there will be three sales before then. The Founders auctions on Binance and WAX, followed by a pack sale for in-game NFT items in early February.

The game will not be free to play. Players need a Brawler and a Ring NFT to participate in the play to earn activities. Rare and Legendary Rings allow multiple participants for extra insanity! Brawlers face off against opponents to earn BRWL, the official Blockchain Brawlers token. Higher rarity Brawlers earn more and they can also be equipped with weapons for additional bonuses. In addition to earning BRWL tokens, players have a chance to find gold NFTs after a match. These will be used for special upgrades.
