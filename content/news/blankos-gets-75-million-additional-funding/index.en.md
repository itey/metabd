**Mythical Games, the studio behind the upcoming blockchain-powered game Blankos Block Party, has received another $75 million in funding. This brings the total of their funding to $120 million. If that entire budget would be put in the development of one game, we’d be talking about AAA budgets.**

However, the funding isn’t for [Blankos Block Party](https://www.playtoearn.online/tag/blankos-block-party/) alone. Mythical Games will use the money to continue the development of Blankos Block Party and development tools for future games. The funding will also be used to bring Blankos to other gaming systems, perhaps consoles. Furthermore, they have plans to release another project later this year, and more in 2022.

Currently [Mythical Games](https://www.playtoearn.online/tag/mythical-games/) is testing its own NFT marketplace. In addition the team has the Mythical Economic Engine in development, which would be a blueprint for third-party developers to create blockchain-powered games.

Mythical Games will make several big announcements next week during a keynote at the 2021 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). Viewers can tune in on Monday, June 14 at 11:10 a.m. PDT, when Mythical will also release one of the first NFT drops on Twitch.tv.

## Play-to-earn and mashing

The newly introduced Party Pass gives [players the ability to earn](https://www.playtoearn.online/tag/play-to-earn/) Blanko Bucks, which is the in-game currency, and Blanko NFTs. Through Party Pass there are daily, weekly and seasonal challenges. Each of those quests earns you Hype Points, and those eventually unlock the rewards. Think about Moola, Blanko Bucks, but also emotes or a special Blanko.

In Blanko Block Party players can add all kinds of accessoires to their character, giving them a hat, a jetpack and a crazy weapon. With the newest update the developers added a lot more options for customization to the game. Players can either get into Mixing or Mashing.

Mixing requires players to use a Gumball item. These are new collectibles that can either be earned through Party Pass or bought from the shop. Mixing basically allows you to add new colors to a Blanko. The other customization option, Mashing, allows players to sample pieces from one Blanko and put them on a new one. 

## What is Blankos Block Party?

Blankos Block Party is an open-world multiplayer game styled like a giant block party. The game has a focus on building, exploration and curating your collection of unique and rare Blankos. The game is coming to PC, but will very likely also make an appearance on console systems.

Blankos Block Party is a party game in which users can enjoy curated and user generated content. This can range from races to shooting challenges, from platforming to other crazy stuff. Users can build creations on the fly using assets available to them, while venturing into new adventures with their personally owned Blankos characters. Blankos Block Party focuses on user generated content, and it introduces a frictionless NFT economy.

Blankos uses the so-called dGoods format for its NFTs. The team at Mythical has build their dGoods system in such a way that NFTs can move across different chains. Because this way they want to make sure that the technology doesn’t limit the liquidity for players.

Blankos Block Party is using the blockchain technology from EOSIO, similar to EOS and WAX. However, the team of Mythical Games has the ambition to connect their game economy to other blockchains as well.
