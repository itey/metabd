**A new virtual world has entered the metaverse, as Bloktopia aims the become a social education hub for those interested in crypto and blockchain technology. The virtual world of Bloktopia will introduce and teach people about blockchain and crypto, while also allowing users to play games and earn some tokens.**

This virtual world, again wrongly dubbed a metaverse, will have a native token called BLOK. Users will be able to purchase virtual real-estate inside Bloktopia. But of course they can stake their BLOK, or use BLOK to advertise their business. Users will be able to create locations, showcase artworks, design challenges, all using a simple builder tool. For more advanced designer there will be an SDK to fill the world of Bloktopia with social games and applications.

Bloktopia will have land sales, and each piece of real-estate is an NFT. The first sale will happen after the token distribution event of BLOK. Users can build and trade, or lease their land for passive income. Other good news for BLOK token holders, as they will receive a share of the in-world advertising revenue. BLOK will go for sale through an IDO at with $0.00025 price tag on Red Kite, Seedify, 0xBull and Trustpad on October 5th and 6th.

Last week [Blocktopia](https://www.bloktopia.com/) already announced a $4.2 million investment round led by Animoca Brands, with financial support from influencers like Jake Paul, Crypto Wendy and Ben “Bitboy Crypto” Armstrong. In addition companies like Polygon, Kucoin and Travala have put money behind Bloktopia, so we already know about some of the services that will appear inside the world: booking your holidays, making trades and showcasing NFTs.

## So, metaverse, what is this metaverse?

The metaverse is everywhere. It’s all around us. Even now, on this very website. You can see it when you swap your tokens. You can experience it when you visit the Play to Earn Game Festival or when you do some battles in Lunacia. And you can feel it when you work, when you’re shopping on an NFT marketplace, and when you login to a service using your wallet. The metaverse is the world that connects us all.

There are many projects in the blockchain space that I adore for all kinds of reasons. However, some of those projects try to own the term ‘[metaverse](https://www.playtoearn.online/tag/metaverse/)‘. They say stuff like ‘the metaverse of our game’. That’s wrong. There’s no such thing as a metaverse of one thing. The metaverse is the air we all breath no matter where we go. The metaverse is inclusive, and it doesn’t discriminate or limit. In the metaverse there is no space for walls and borders, because the tools that make the metaverse are there to break those borders down. Those who build walls, ultimately will remove themselves from the metaverse, while the metaverse will just continue without them. The metaverse is open, interoperable and persistent. **[Let’s get into that a bit deeper](https://www.playtoearn.online/2021/04/08/whats-the-metaverse/)**.
