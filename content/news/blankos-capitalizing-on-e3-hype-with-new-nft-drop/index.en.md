**Alongside a major update to the Blankos store, Mythical Games [will have](https://blog.blankos.com/major-drop-june-16th-and-17th) one Blanko NFT drop today and two others on Thursday, June 17th. Designer Nicky Davis will drop 4,000 of his Rougarou Blankos, while there will be an unlimited supply of Glitter Goth and Menace characters the day after.**

Rougarou is the next Blankos by Nicky Davis. With 4,000 editions only, it’s likely to sell out at some point. Earlier this month they dropped Kitsune, a Blankos by Candie Bolton. It had a $150 price tag and a supply of 400. Rougarou will be a lot cheaper, with a $20 price tag. The sale will start at this Wednesday, June 16th at 3PM PDT, or 22:00 UTC. The other two characters will drop on Thursday for $15 at the same time, but have an unlimited supply. You could try to get a low serial number though.

When talking about unlimited supply, it’s important to note that these Blankos character will be time-limited. After a while they will disappear from the store to never come back. The same faith happened today to Nicky Davis’ first Blankos, Bullseye. In addition the Freddy Yeti will disappear from the store tomorrow. This one has only been in store for 2 weeks. It looks like an NFT drop in Blankos is really available for a short amount of time.

## Blankos at E3 2021

At the E3 2021 event Mythical Games has [announced](https://www.playtoearn.online/2021/06/14/deadmau5-and-burberry-coming-to-blankos-this-summer/) partnerships with music artist Deadmau5 and fashion label Burberry for their game Blankos Block Party. This summer they will launch exclusive Blankos NFTs following these specific brands. Aside from Burberry and [Deadmau5](https://www.playtoearn.online/tag/deadmau5/), more designers and artists will work with Blankos. The team revealed collaborations with Michael Lau, Quiccs, and The Marathon Clothing. We also spotted the [Hackatao](https://www.playtoearn.online/tag/hackatao/) logo in the presentation.

## Play-to-earn and mashing

The newly introduced Party Pass gives [players the ability to earn](https://www.playtoearn.online/tag/play-to-earn/) Blanko Bucks, which is the in-game currency, and Blanko NFTs. Through Party Pass there are daily, weekly and seasonal challenges. Each of those quests earns you Hype Points, and those eventually unlock the rewards. Think about Moola, Blanko Bucks, but also emotes or a special Blanko.

In Blanko Block Party players can add all kinds of accessoires to their character, giving them a hat, a jetpack and a crazy weapon. With the newest update the developers added a lot more options for customization to the game. Players can either get into Mixing or Mashing.

Mixing requires players to use a Gumball item. These are new collectibles that can either be earned through Party Pass or bought from the shop. Mixing basically allows you to add new colors to a Blanko. The other customization option, Mashing, allows players to sample pieces from one Blanko and put them on a new one. 

## What is Blankos Block Party?

Blankos Block Party is an open-world multiplayer game styled like a giant block party. The game has a focus on building, exploration and curating your collection of unique and rare Blankos. The game is coming to PC, but will very likely also make an appearance on console systems. Blankos Block Party is using the blockchain technology from EOSIO, similar to EOS and WAX.

Blankos Block Party is a party game in which users can enjoy curated and user generated content. This can range from races to shooting challenges, from platforming to other crazy stuff. Users can build creations on the fly using assets available to them, while venturing into new adventures with their personally owned Blankos characters. Blankos Block Party focuses on user generated content, and it introduces a frictionless NFT economy.

Blankos uses the so-called dGoods format for its NFTs. The team at Mythical has build their dGoods system in such a way that NFTs can move across different chains. Because this way they want to make sure that the technology doesn’t limit the liquidity for players.
