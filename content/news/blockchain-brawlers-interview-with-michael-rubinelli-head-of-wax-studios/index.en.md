## What is Blockchain Brawlers?

Developed by WAX Studios, an offshoot of the official WAX organization, [Blockchain Brawlers](https://www.bcbrawlers.com/) is an upcoming play to earn game. Looking like a mixture of WWE, Mexican wrestling, and cage match brawls, Blockchain brawlers brings some some wrestling zaniness to the gaming world.

Expected to launch in early Q2 2022 the game will not be free to play. Players need a Brawler and a Ring NFT to participate in the play-to-earn activities. Rare and Legendary Rings allow multiple participants for extra insanity! Brawlers face off against opponents to earn BRWL, the official Blockchain Brawlers token. Higher rarity Brawlers earn more and they can also be equipped with weapons for additional bonuses. In addition to earning BRWL tokens, players have a chance to find gold NFTs after a match. These will be used for special upgrades.
