**German football club Bayern Munich has joined the Sorare fantasy football game. Starting from Tuesday cards will be auctioned from players like for example rising star Alphonso Davies, German midfielder Joshua Kimmich and the powerful striker Robert Lewandowski. Bayern Munchen is the third German team joining the fantasy football game.**

Schalke 04 and Bayer Leverkusen were already part of Sorare, and that makes Bayern Munich the third German team. Sorare signed the Russian team [Krasnodar](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/11/05/sorare-adds-krasnodar-to-fantasy-football-game/) last week, while [Paris Saint Germain](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/09/29/neymar-and-mbappe-join-football-game-sorare/) joined in September.

Bayern Munchen won the Champions League in 2020. In addition the German club has won a record 30 national titles. The club was already involved in blockchain gaming, as they signed a partnership with Stryking [last year](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stryking-and-fc-bayern-munich-sign-licensing-partnership-for-digital-collectibles-300936787.html).

According to data from [Nonfungible.com](https://nonfungible.com/) Sorare has had 3.8 million dollars in sales so far. That makes the platform the seventh biggest project of all time, behind Gods Unchained, Axie Infinity, Decentraland, Cryptokitties, MyCryptoHeroes and SuperRare. According to [Opensea](https://opensea.io/rankings) Sorare has had 572 ETH in trading volume in the past week.

### What is Sorare?

Sorare is a fantasy football game powered by blockchain technology. The project also has support from game publisher Ubisoft through the company’s entrepreneurs lab. The fantasy football game is enjoying lots of hype in recent months. For example, the game is among the most active applications on the Ethereum blockchain. In July the company received a four million dollar investment to push the game forward. Before the end of the year, the Paris-based company [wants](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/07/16/sorare-looking-to-double-their-licensed-clubs/) to have approximately 150 different clubs in their portfolio.

Blockchain technology introduces actual scarcity to digital cards, so these cards have a limited supply. Players can use the cards they’ve bought to create a fantasy team. Each card represents a real player. As a result of the performance of that player on the actual pitch, card holders will earn points. Weekly Sorare is handing out hundreds of playing cards and more than 7700 dollars in prizes.

The cheapest cards generally sell for a couple of dollars, while the most wanted ones go for well over a thousand dollars a piece. [Join the game!](https://sorare.com/)
