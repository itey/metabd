**The Mythical Marketplace for Blankos Block Party [will launch](https://blog.blankos.com/mythical-marketplace-enters-beta) its beta version this week, introducing payouts into crypto wallets, browsing without being logged in and supporting more countries. In addition the marketplace will allow users to directly connect the marketplace to their bank account.**

The Mythical Marketplace and Blankos Block Party launched initially as a project that was a bit isolated, running on a custom EOSIO blockchain. However, Blankos will connect with Ethereum for its NFTs and the marketplace now also broadens its scope. Next month they will also introduce crypto payments, adding more flexibility to the way people pay for their NFTs.

In order to transfer money from Blankos to your bank account, you will need [an Uphold account](https://uphold.com/). This platform obviously has a KYC system, requiring you to reveal your identity.

## What is Blankos Block Party?

[Blankos Block Party](https://www.playtoearn.online/tag/blankos-block-party/) is an open-world multiplayer game styled like a giant block party. The game has a focus on building, exploration and curating your collection of unique and rare Blankos. The game is coming to PC, but will very likely also make an appearance on console systems. Blankos Block Party is using the blockchain technology from EOSIO, similar to EOS and WAX.

Blankos Block Party is a party game in which users can enjoy curated and user generated content. This can range from races to shooting challenges, from platforming to other crazy stuff. Users can build creations on the fly using assets available to them, while venturing into new adventures with their personally owned Blankos characters. Blankos Block Party focuses on user generated content, and it introduces a frictionless [NFT Marketplace](https://www.playtoearn.online/tag/nft-marketplace/).

Blankos uses the so-called dGoods format for its NFTs. The team at Mythical has build their dGoods system in such a way that NFTs can move across different chains. Because this way they want to make sure that the technology doesn’t limit the liquidity for players. Players can win new NFTs every month, [thanks to the Party Pass](https://www.playtoearn.online/2021/08/20/next-blankos-party-pass-offers-7-nft-rewards/).
