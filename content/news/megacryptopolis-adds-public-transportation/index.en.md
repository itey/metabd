description: "Any urban center, even a virtual one, needs transportation options, and MegaCryptoPolis will add those in an upcoming update. A big update scheduled to launch on Tuesday, will add mobility improvements. With no fewer than seven different modes of transportation added, Citizens should have no trouble finding a way to get around the city. This will be especially important as MCP3D ramps up their efforts to create a city simulation."
