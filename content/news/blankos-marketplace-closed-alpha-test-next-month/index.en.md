**The online party game Blankos Block Party will soon use its own marketplace to allow gamers to buy and sell Blankos characters and other NFTs. Mythical Games has [revealed](https://blog.blankos.com/mythical-marketplace-introduction) a work-in-progress version of their Mythical Marketplace, a web-based marketplace where users can buy items using USD or ETH. In the future the marketplace will be integrated into Blankos.**

An alpha version of the marketplace will go live in May. They will test this early version with a select number of players. Mythical expects their marketplace to go into open beta in the early summer of this year.

The marketplace will allow users to filter Blankos characters and accessoires. In addition they can filter on price, boxed versions, serial numbers, character level and for example skill class. Players can also search among individual character types, while the character page provides info about season, number of Blankos issued and the number burned.

Even though gamers can pay using USD or ETH, the marketplace itself is running on a custom blockchain based on the EOSIO chain. Over time the developers will add more currency options and the ability for on- and off-ramps to transfer your crypto into money on your bank account.

### What is Blankos Block Party?

Blankos Block Party is an open-world multiplayer game styled like a giant block party. The game has a focus on building, exploration and curating your collection of unique and rare Blankos. The game is coming to PC, but will very likely also make an appearance on console systems.

Blankos Block Party is a party game in which users can enjoy curated and user generated content. This can range from races to shooting challenges, from platforming to other crazy stuff. Users can build creations on the fly using assets available to them, while venturing into new adventures with their personally owned Blankos characters. Blankos Block Party focuses on user generated content, and it introduces a frictionless NFT economy.

Blankos uses the so-called dGoods format for its NFTs. The team at Mythical has build their dGoods system in such a way that NFTs can move across different chains. Because this way they want to make sure that the technology doesn’t limit the liquidity for players.

Blankos Block Party is using the blockchain technology from EOSIO, similar to EOS and WAX. However, the team of Mythical Games has the ambition to connect their game economy to other blockchains as well.
