For those intrepid folks who solved all of the riddles, or those who simply acquired the necessary materials through the markets, the time has arrived for assembling the Genesis Habitats! These Habitats will serve as home base for your Genopets and offer potential income through token and Crystal generation.

The move to earn gaming scene seems to have suddenly sprung to life, with no less than four different games in the genre hitting the news. Not only do we have Genopets, StepN, and Dust Runner on Solana, but now [DEFY joins the mix as well](https://www.playtoearn.online/2022/04/08/defy-in-the-race-to-be-the-first-move-to-earn-augmented-reality-game/)! But we’re here to talk about minting Genopets Habitats.

[![Genopets Habitat](http://www.playtoearn.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Genopets_habitat1.jpg)](https://www.playtoearn.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Genopets_habitat1.jpg)*Genopets Habitat*

Habitat minting for Genopets opened on April 4th and runs for a month. Once the window for minting ends, no more Genesis Habitats will ever be created. Any unused Refined Crystals can be later used in the game. Creating a Habitat requires five Refined Crystals, one of each type (Earth, Water, Metal, Fire and Wood), a Terraform Seed, 10 GENE tokens, and a little bit of SOL for transaction fees.

## Genopets Genesis Habitats

Habitats are 3D, generative landscapes that function as homes for the Genopets. And while the game is free to play, the benefits of owning a Habitat are many. Habitats provide bonus token earning, produce unrefined crystals, and refine crystals. They also are the central point for crafting and pet upgrading. Habitats upgrade, allowing for quicker crystal production and refinement. Habitats produce unrefined crystals daily. After refining, crystals become NFTs that can be sold and traded.

Each Habitat is procedurally generated during the minting process. The player drags the five crystals onto the Terraform Seed. How they do so, apparently has an effect on the Habitat generation! What sort of effect and how exactly it works we don’t know. And probably never will. But just keep in mind, that as you mint your Habitat, you are making it uniquely yours!

A side effect of this on-the-fly procedural mint, is a bit of a delay between mint and reveal of the actual Habitat. So, anyone purchasing on the secondary markets can choose to pick up an already revealed Habitat or take their chance on a Mystery Box! Low range cost for Habitats currently sits at about 20 SOL. Picking up all five of the Refined Elements to craft your own would cost about 25 SOL. SOL is going for over $100 per token at the moment, so either option is not a cheap investment.

But remember, these Crystals were available to anyone for practically free. You just had to [solve the puzzles](https://www.playtoearn.online/2022/02/26/genopets-treasure-hunt-for-genesis-habitats/)!

And though these Habitats may have a specific, elemental, visual theme, Genesis Habitats will be able to create any type of Refined Crystal. This allows for much greater flexibility in the game. They also offer bonus tokens when cashing in daily steps.

## What is Genopets?

[Genopets](https://www.genopets.me/) is a free to play, “move to earn” game built on the Solana blockchain. Genopets uses data tracked by a smartphone or fitness wearable to level up a Genopet NFT in the game. Players can then summon their pet, and quest in the Genoverse to explore hidden lands, find loot, craft items and battle with other players. This also means that gamers can walk around, level up their NFT and then sell their progress on the public marketplace. That’s why they embrace the term: move-to-earn.

The[ play-to-earn](https://www.playtoearn.online/whats-the-play-to-earn-business-model/) economy of Genopets consists out of four elements:

- GENE token – the governance and staking token for Genopets
- KI token – the reward and utility token
- XP – a state in the Genopet NFT meta data which can increase through activity
- Gene Crystals – NFTs crafted from GENE and KI to accelerate and direct to evolution of a Genopet

Habitats are NFTs players can purchase or craft in-game and the main gateway into play to earn. Each Habitat holds one Genopet. Habitats generate Crystals and KI tokens passively, while also increasing the experience your Genopet earns. Players must maintain their Habitats or production stops.

Players can generate income from leveling up Genopets and selling them. Or they can build a habitat and sell the Crystals and KI tokens produced. The GENE token exists on both Solana and Binance blockchains.
