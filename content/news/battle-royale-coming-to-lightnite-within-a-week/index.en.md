**Satoshi’s Games is [close to releasing](https://twitter.com/lightnitegame/status/1437872052715798538) the game mode Lightnite fans have all been waiting for, battle royale. In a teaser they called the mode ‘the most epic moment’ of their game, and they are probably right. Lightnite is an online shooter where players use the Bitcoin Lightning Network to play, win and earn BTC. But of course, you can also play and lose.**

Lightnite always had the end goal to become a battle royale game, but it has been a long time coming. Satoshi’s Games first introduced a variety of other modes, ranging from free-for-all deathmatch, to team deathmatch and a COVID game mode. The battle royale mode really always was the end goal for Lightnite, because – let’s face it – the name is inspired by the popular battle royale game Fortnite.

In recent months the developers have added all kinds of features that players will need in a battle royale game. Think about adding sniper guns, but also the ability to pick up weapons and ammo. The game has been playable for quite some time, but corpse looting was only introduced in June this year. Who’s ready to play Lightnite’s battle royale mode?

## What is Lightnite?

Gamers who play [Lightnite](https://lightnite.io/) can earn bitcoin by shooting other players. However, they will lose bitcoin when they get shot. Players can sell some of the items found in the game for bitcoin as well. On top of that they can withdraw the bitcoin they earned in Lightnite immediately. Another example of a fine play-to-earn mechanic, even though you could potentially also lose sats of course.

Essentially Lightnite is a low-poly version of Fortnite, which means it’s a game in the battle royale genre. However, the game offers multiple game modes for different types of players. According to the development roadmap the game will have its official release later this summer.

In May the team [announced](https://www.playtoearn.online/2021/05/18/bitcoin-nfts-now-available-on-elixer-market/) that players can now trade NFTs. These NFTs are stored on the Liquid Network, and can for example be traded on Elixir Market. For the transactions during gameplay, Lightnite uses the Bitcoin Lightning Network.
