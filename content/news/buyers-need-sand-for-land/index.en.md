description: "Gamers, investors and creatives who are interested in buying a piece of land in one of the upcoming land sales for The Sandbox, will need to do that using the SAND token. In a community AMA session Sebastien Borget from The Sandbox made clear that SAND is now at the center of everything that happens surrounding The Sandbox. This includes the sale of virtual land."

**Sorare has [signed an agreement](https://medium.com/sorare/bundesliga-and-bundesliga-2-join-sorare-8d0a8c22acb3) with the German Bundesliga, adding both the first and second league from Germany to the fantasy football game. The agreement with the first and second Bundesliga follows the one with the German national team this summer. This also means that Sorare now has 200 clubs in their database, ranging from Japan to the American MSL and from Argentina to Germany.**

Despite the announcement, the NFTs from the Bundesliga aren’t available yet. Sorare expects to launch these by the end of October. Clubs like Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig, Wolfsburg and Union Berlin will now become part of the fantasy football game. This means that fan favorites like Erling Haaland, Leroy Sané and Wout Weghorst will now enter the game.

Despite the agreement, Sorare will not release cards based on the second Bundesliga. However, cards of players now active in the lower league will now be tracked as well.

## Introducing Sorare Moments

Details about this are still lacking a bit, but Sorare also announced a new collectible NFT. They named it Sorare Moments, and these cards feature memorable moments. These collectibles will launch with Sorare Bundesliga Moments in 2022, and they will share more details about their utility ahead of the release next year.

If you’re interested in catching a glimpse of an early version of these Sorare Moments, check the video in the tweet below and scroll to 00:40.

## How to play Sorare

You can play Sorare for free, but that takes away lots of the excitement to be fair. You need to purchase collectible player cards, and the players on these cards will become your team. Each game week you select the players, each represented by an NFT card, of which you think they will perform best.

For every game week managers will need to select a team from the player card collection. They will need one goalkeeper, one defender, one midfielder, one attacker and an extra field player. Players earn points based on the real-life performance of those players. Therefore players that play regularly, are active in winning team, hardly make mistakes, and score a lot of goals, are generally valuable. Each card can only be used once during a game week, but if you have enough cards you can join in multiple leagues.

If you make enough points, you will earn 0.01 or 0.02 ETH. Are you among the best? Then you will receive a free card, which are much more valuable.
