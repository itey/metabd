**Starting from today the blockchain-powered Atari VCS gaming console will [officially](https://twitter.com/TheAtari_VCS/status/1404870597759352837) be available in stores. Gamers interested in picking one up, can do so at Micro Center and Best Buy. The consoles will soon also be available at GameStop.**

Gamers who are on top of things, will know that the Atari VCS has been in the hands of certain gamers [for some time already](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/09/30/atari-shipping-first-atari-vcs-gaming-consoles/). Atari first launched the console through the Indiegogo crowdfunding platform, and additionally they did a pre-sale. However, now the Atari VCS console will be available in stores.

The Atari VCS isn’t a retro console, even though it sure looks a lot like the classic Atari 2600. No, this console is pretty high-tech and almost competes with last generation consoles like the Playstation 4 and Xbox One. However, the reason why we talk about Atari VCS is because it [embraces blockchain technology](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/08/04/atari-vcs-becomes-first-blockchain-gaming-console/).

### Atari VCS and blockchain gaming

The Atari VCS is an indication about how serious Atari is when it comes to the blockchain space. The company has their own Atari Token (ATRI), invested in The Sandbox, partnered with Animoca Brands, and integrated blockchain-powered distribution platform Ultra into their console. The Atari VCS supports many classic Atari games, but also modern games and blockchain-powered games.

The legendary gaming company recently [announced](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/08/04/atari-vcs-becomes-first-blockchain-gaming-console/) the system’s focus on blockchain gaming. The integration of the entire Ultra platform into the system is a clear example of that. This allows users to for example buy, download, play, and sell games.

Atari and Animoca Brands have [recently](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/08/04/atari-vcs-becomes-first-blockchain-gaming-console/) expanded their partnership. As a result Animoca now has access to the global development and distribution rights for several brands including Pong, Asteroids and Centipede. The list also includes Breakout, Missile Command, Tempest, Lunar Lander, Space Duel, Agent X, Night Driver, Star Raiders and more. In total Animoca licensed 15 titles.
