**Everybody is now able to play the online grand strategy game Blocklords after the developers released the open beta. The open beta follows the second closed beta that started in November 2019. Gamers can sign up on the official website using their email address, and play the game directly in their browser.**

Blocklords is a grand strategy game in which players are a hero, amassing an army to conquer the massive open world. On their journey players will find items, and they can sell these, or keep them. In addition they need to build alliances with other players.

Even though the Ethereum blockchain is the main attraction, Blocklords also offers support for Tron and NEO. By playing, gamers can create value and sell their items on the open marketplace. On the Ethereum blockchain the game uses the Matic side-chain for cheaper and faster transactions.

Join the Blocklords open beta on the [official website](https://play.blocklords.io/).

### What is Blocklords?

Blocklords takes gamers to a medieval time when power was determined through strength, cunning and the ability to use your wealth against others. Thrown into the dark ages, players must do whatever it takes to survive. Blocklords has an user-driven economy, on-chain PVP battles, and grand strategy outlook. Create your unique lord and build a dynasty that will see you raise to the top, or die trying. The choice is yours!

The game stores all heroes, items and in-game resources on the blockchain, making them immutable and preventing fraud. The blockchain also adds the possibilities for a player-owned government. For example, all in-game nations are ruled entirely by players, and economic and social policies are all set by nation leaders. The map contains a set amount of cities and villages. Therefore, more players means more battles for control.
