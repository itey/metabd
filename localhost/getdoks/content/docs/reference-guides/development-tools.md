## Linting

## Development server

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="Get your local IP address by running <code>netstat -r</code> from the command line. Your IP address will be in the first (Destination) column." />}}

Doks makes the Hugo development webserver accessible by default at `http://localhost:1313` and `http://<local-ip-address>:1313`. The latter is handy for e.g. testing locally on mobile devices. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

### Netlify DEV

Doks' `./netlify.toml` excerpt:

```toml
[dev]
  framework = "#custom"
  command = "npx rimraf public resources functions && npx hugo server --bind=0.0.0.0 --disableFastRender"
  targetPort = 1313
  port = 8888
  publish = "public"
  autoLaunch = false
```
