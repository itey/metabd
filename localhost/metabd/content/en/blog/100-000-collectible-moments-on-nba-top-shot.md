Two collectible moments on basketball platform NBA Top Shot changed hands for $100.000 on Sunday. The first one was the first mint of a Holo MMXX Series 1 edition of a block by Zion Williamson, while the second one was a first mint of a block by LeBron James in the From the Top series. These two purchases are currently the highest value NFTs on the platform. 



In the past 7 days there have been plenty of high valued purchases of collectible moments on NBA Top Shot. Just by looking at Cryptoslam we can see that ten out of sixteen top purchases are from NBA Top Shot. The licensed NBA collectible platform has had 17 million dollars in marketplace sales in the past week, which is up 338 percent from the week before. 



On Saturday we reported a sales record of $71.455. It only took investors, collectors and buyers one day to break that record, twice. During the weekend Roham Gharegozlou, CEO from Dapper Labs, was hyping his platform on Twitter: ¡°Top sales on NBA Top Shot this morning, marketplace is on fire!¡±.



Why NBA Top Shot is so hot right now



The strength of the project is twofold. First of all Dapper Labs made the Flow blockchain in such a way that people have an easy experience on-boarding into?NBA Top Shot. Users will have no problems with private keys and gas fees. Many users are praising the interface made by Dapper Labs on social media.



Second, these digital collectibles are officially licensed by the NBA. They are the real deal and feature stars like for example LeBron James,?Spencer Dinwiddie?and many more. These collectibles come in different rarities, because of this prices for collectibles go from 1 dollar all the way to a couple of thousand dollars. Many collectors want to get in early, before the mainstream audience comes in and really pumps prices.
