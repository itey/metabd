An anonymous buyer acquired CryptoPunks alien punk #7804 for a record $7.560.000. This instantly makes this alien punk the most expensive NFT ever sold, shattering the previous record 5 times. NFT collectors consider alien punks among the most valuable, because there are only nine of them in the series of ten thousand. 



Alien punks are among the most wanted CryptoPunks in the series. However, they haven¡¯t sold much. In January one alien punk sold for $762.000, immediately resulting in million dollar bids on other alien punks. However, the owners never accepted these bids. 



Flamingo DAO acquired that previous alien punk. It¡¯s still a bit unsure who bought alien punk 7804, but I wouldn¡¯t be surprised if an NFT fund or DAO is again behind it.



New record NFT sale incoming



Even though this record sale for punk 7804 is jaw-dropping, it won¡¯t be the biggest NFT sale for long. Beeple¡¯s Everydays: The First 5000 Days is currently in auction at Christie¡¯s. With still 8 hours on the clock, the highest bid is currently $13.250.000. When the auction ends, there will automatically be a new record holder.



Beeple¡¯s art sales have been on fire lately. On the secondary market Beeple artworks are among the most valuable NFTs. According to DappRadar someone bought his Politics is Bullshit #2/100 for 333.33 ETH or $615 thousand earlier this week. 



Why are Cryptopunks so valuable?



CryptoPunks is a?crypto art?initiative that generated ten thousand different 24¡Á24 punk-looking avatars. There are a few rares ones, like apes, zombies and an alien.?Besides being a digital collectible, the project doesn¡¯t offer any additional usage. However, Cryptopunks are often part of digital art galleries in virtual worlds like Cryptovoxels and Decentraland.



We can¡¯t say that Cryptopunks are technically advanced non-fungible tokens. However, it¡¯s the first collectible art project ever that used the Ethereum blockchain to mint collectibles. Because of their historical significance, Cryptopunks are valuable digital assets. There are only ten thousand punks on the market. Rarity and scarcity push up the value.
