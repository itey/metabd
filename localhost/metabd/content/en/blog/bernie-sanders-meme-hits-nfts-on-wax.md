Collectible card company Topps has announced Garbage Pail Kids: Berventures, which is a collectible on the Wax blockchain that taps into the Bernie Sanders Meme. Original art and motion sketch collectibles based on Bernie Sanders will sell right now through the official website.



After the Bernie Sanders collectible sale on Wax, collectors can burn their collectible to earn points for a chance to earn special mitten packs. The sale will end on Friday January 29th and 3:59AM UTC or 11:59PM ET. 



These packs contain rare animated GPK Bernventure cards and exclusive mitten cards. Burning common cards earns collectors one point, while legendary cards are worth 150 point. Burning cards for these exclusive rewards will be possible until January 31st at 3:59AM UTC or 11:59PM ET.



Topps has been releasing digital collectibles on Wax for almost one year now. The first Garbage Pail Kids series sold out very fast, and with GPK they organized a card burning event before. The Wax platform has also been home to collectibles from Deadmau5 and KOGs. 





Rarity on the blockchain



For years we¡¯ve been curating content on Instagram and collecting achievements on Playstation and Xbox. Apparently we are a generation who loves digital collectibles. However, collectibles are only really collectibles when there¡¯s a certain rarity. That¡¯s where the blockchain comes into place. Through blockchain technology the total supply and ownership of digital assets can be controlled. The technology verifies whether someone has an original version of a digital asset or merely a screenshot.



While physical collectibles could provide a thousand assets, we¡¯d never be able to locate all of them. Rare physical games could become less valuable when suddenly a box of unopened first edition pops-up in an old warehouse. On the blockchain the supply is always clear, and burning mechanisms feed into the concepts of rarity and collectability. Destroying digital assets to (potentially) acquire new ones, is an interesting way for digital collectibles to deal with rarity.



Topps is now introducing this concept to its Garbage Pail Kids digital collectibles. However, it¡¯s quite safe to say that gaming will also deal with this. Card games like?Gods Unchained?and?Synergy of Serra?are likely to embrace the same concept, as it would create utility for older cards which in turn creates demand for new cards.?Last year Tribal Books burned?all the remaining assets from its pre-sale to make sure that these first assets are truly scarce.
